She too has cheated on partners with him as well. \nHe was recently served child support papers, he arrested for domestic battery a few years ago, she caused him to lose his job for other reasons. There was a point where she left her kids behind due some mental issues but later came to reclaim the children not allowing him to see them after he‚Äôs taken care of them for months on his own. They have both been physically, mentally and emotionally abusive towards each other. She has assaulted friends and family members of his as well. \nThey are now divorced. But they continue to be in serious relationships with other people but refuse to stay together and fix what they have. \nI would think as a mother or father of your kids I would demand the new person out and away from our children so we could be together or have sex in peace, but they are okay with being the ‚Äúside chick‚Äù and ‚Äúside guy‚Äù more than they were being a wife and husband. \nIt doesn‚Äôt make sense to me, but I was hoping someone would help me understand why this is so common nowadays. \n\nThank you in advance!"

The first few dates were wonderful and we were always texting each other. For context this guy recently moved to the city I'm currently living in and just getting adjusted to things. He recently got a new job and his replies were getting less frequent. So I just assumed he's just adjusting to his new job and tried my best to be understanding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow he would take days to reply, which is a sudden shift from before and I've noticed that I've initiated most of the conversations nowadays.\n\nWe caught up over a quick dinner recently and I wanted to ask him about our current relationship, if he wanted to become official. He said he wanted to think about it before giving me an answer, which is completely fine. Recently he has told me that he has got time off work recently as well as the holidays are coming up. So I tried inviting him out but the message hasn't been opened in a day or two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead of spending my time worrying about his reply, I went out to just have a self care day and maybe meet up with some friends. While I was waiting for my friends, I caught glimpse of him with another guy. The way I knew it was romantic is because they kissed each other goodbye and hugged before parting ways. My heart felt broken seeing that sight, and made my worries spiral out of control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLogically, I think it's fine to see other people if you aren't completely official with each other, but something about seeing that made me want to die in that moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do now, I find it hard to confide with people that I'm close with and usually quite private with my dating life.

The bulk of our relationship currently is long-distance as I am finishing up university a few states away from our hometown and he is back home working in a corporate job. He has flown out to my university to visit me, and I am flying home on Monday for the holidays. We have both been talking about how much we are looking forward to seeing each other. I'll be planning to move back home after I graduate this next semester.\n\nWe've been saying 'i love you' for quite a while now. He said it first, if that matters. He has met my parents, but to him it didn't really count as it was a 5-minute casual conversation as he picked me up and about a 45 minute conversation about wine another night. Not too sure, but I think he is looking for a more formal 'meet-the-parents' type of deal. \n\nI was supposed to meet his parents, his twin brother, and his younger sister on Tuesday for dinner and he was supposed to join for a casual family party on Wednesday night, but he has since asked to raincheck Wednesday (because he feels quite a bit of pressure to meet the whole family that way) and to postpone me meeting his family (as he feels it's too soon in our dating period). I said that it was fine, and that we can slow things down. I don't want him to feel pressured to do anything. He said he came to feel this way after lots of introspection. This conversation happened late last week or very early this week, I can't quite remember.\n\nUp until about 2 days ago, he was still saying 'i love you'. He's been acting quite a bit off lately, but he won't go into much detail, but when I've said 'i love you' the past few days, he's completely ignored it and made no acknowledgement of it. No 'love you too', no 'I feel the same way', absolutely nothing.\n\nWithin the past 6 times I've said it, I've noticed total ignorance of it. I won't lie, it definitely hurts quite a bit. I've asked him if everything is okay, because I've noticed he's been off, but he just says that he has a lot on his mind. I'm hesitant to bring it up, because I don't want to make a big deal out of it, especially because I could just be making a mountain out of a molehill here. If he wanted me to stop saying that I loved him because he felt uncomfortable, I would. \n\nBesides this, everything else seems to be pretty normal between us. He still texts me every day, he still calls me like normal, he still uses the same pet names for me...I'm just wondering if sometimes guys just stop saying it randomly? Or rather, i guess I'm asking for advice on the best way to proceed or broach this topic with him. I know we can talk face-to-face on Monday, but i wouldn't really know how to even start this conversation.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend randomly stopped saying 'I love you' to me and I'm wondering if this is normal and also how should I approach this conversation with him?"

My husband had a grandmother and we spent so much time with her and she basically raised my husband while my husband's parents raised his sister. His grandmother passed away about 7 months ago.  His grandmother only had one child, which is my mother in law.  After grandmother passed away it was decided by my mother in law that his sister gets her house and all of the things in her house. My husband and I have a house, just had a baby, have stable jobs. My sister in law does cocaine and had a few unwanted pregnancies where she had abortions.  I loved his grandmother very much and would like some jewelry to pass on to my daughter. His sister is engaged to a guy who is possibly abusive. They have a dog and the dog is not potty trained and they allow to dog to urinate and poop anywhere in the house.

It‚Äôs kind of ridiculous to think I‚Äôve come to this point but I felt like I could have done more. I met my ex in the end of October on a dating app. I didn‚Äôt think much of it but we actually connected really well. Soon after, we started dating and because we were long distance, I got a plane ticket and went to go stay with him for 2 weeks. That sounds like a mess too. It was impulsive and fast paced and out of character for me, but we had a good time together. Towards the end of our trip he was struggling more mentally. He had trauma from a previous 2 year relationship that ended in August. I understood, and I just wanted to support him where I could. We both agreed that everything was rushed so upon returning home we agreed to separate and try to ‚Äúrestart‚Äù as good friends (after a month of being together). He just kept getting worse mentally and eventually stopped responding very often. That was okay, I would let him come to me when he had the energy for a conversation. At this point we weren‚Äôt together anyways. I felt like he used this time to keep to himself and stay alone in his room. He wasn‚Äôt particularly outgoing. Then today, I spontaneously asked him if he wanted to play a video game with me, feeling that it may help him get out of his own head. Quickly after this, he told me that he was struggling a lot and that he didn‚Äôt know what he wanted. I tried to give him reassurance that he wasn‚Äôt alone, but he proceeded to block me and many of his other friends on most social media. He unblocked me a little bit later to tell me that he would at least be safe, and that nothing was my fault. He told me he feels he needed a ‚Äúfresh start‚Äù to figure himself out and heal. How am I supposed to feel about this? Someone I really cared for just fell off the face of the earth. The sad part is that I understand, but I am going to miss him and I really hope he comes back, even as a friend. I really do care for him, and I‚Äôm going to wait just because I need to heal myself too. I don‚Äôt expect anything to come out of it, but I feel so lost and confused. I can‚Äôt help but hope we will talk again someday. I don‚Äôt know what to do with these feelings. I know I should take the time to focus on myself and grow, but I can‚Äôt help to worry if I will hear from him again. Our times together were really good, we practically spent every hour of every day talking to each other. Now he‚Äôs gone, looking for a ‚Äúfresh start‚Äù without me. He blocked everyone except for his best friend as far as I know. Makes sense, but this sucks.\n\nTLDR: someone i really cared for disappeared\n\nedit: He also spoke a lot for me, even if it was unintentional. He said he felt like he would hurt me regardless if he stayed or left, and he jumped to conclusions about my intentions when we had a misunderstanding. It felt like he never really ‚Äúheard‚Äù what I wanted to say."

Turns out the wife is crazy & after only 1.5 weeks is making our home very uncomfortable. \n\nSince they haven‚Äôt signed the lease or paid any bills or rent, how do we ask them to move out without destroying the wife‚Äôs feelings & self confidence & my girlfriend‚Äôs and her coworker‚Äôs friendship? \n\nOr do we even ask them to move out? Should we just make do? How would we do this around the crazy wife?  \n\n\n\nBasic Info: \n\nMe - (23 M)\nSally - (23 F) \nHave been dating for 1 year & living together for 1 year.\n\nDan - (24 M) \nRiley - (23 F)\nHave been married 2 years. \n\n\nIntroduction: \n\n**All names have been changed**\n\nMy girlfriend‚Äôs coworker, Dan (24 M), lived in a camper - a disgusting, small, dirty camper with no hot water or internet - with his wife, Riley (23 F). \n\nAll was fine for Dan & Riley until a tornado recently destroyed their heater & tilted their camper. By the time he told my girlfriend this story, they had been living in this heatless, tilted camper for a week in the dead of winter (but we live in Texas, so the winter hasn‚Äôt been that cold; in other words, it‚Äôs bearable). \n\nMy girlfriend, Sally (23 F), who is a really nice person - too nice, I think - instantly offers up our guest bedroom in the house we rent. \n\nBecause Sally had already offered up the room, I felt obligated to give it to them before I met Dan and Riley; that and I also felt bad for them because they were basically living in abject poverty. \n\nNow, be aware, Sally barely knows Riley. She really only offered the room because 1. She‚Äôs a good person, 2. She felt bad for Dan, 3. Dan is her genuine friend. \n\nFast forward, they move in, and we found out Riley is a nut bag. After only 1.5 weeks, Sally & I are incredibly uncomfortable in our own home. \n\nRiley: \n\nRiley is bipolar, has ADHD, anxiety (she has bad, immobilizing anxiety attacks), depression, has horrible social skills, is super annoying, wants to be our best friend, and worst of all: is home 24/7; Dan doesn‚Äôt want her to work because of her mental health issues (Dan somehow supports both of them on his $35k salary), so she just reads, watches TV, or whatever the fuck else all day long - oh and she doesn‚Äôt do chores. She‚Äôs home 24/7. \n\nExamples of Riley‚Äôs Bad Social Skills & Annoying Behavior: \n\n- She randomly brings up trauma in casual conversation, laughs about it, and moves on. \n\nEx. 1) After drinking a lot of water one night she says ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm drowning myself, and as a person who actually tried to drown herself, that‚Äôs saying a lot.‚Äù \n\nEx. 2) She randomly brought up that she was raped as a kid. \n\n- She won‚Äôt stop talking to you, even if you try ending the conversation. \n\nEx.) Sally had talked to Riley for 10-15 minutes and tried to leave the conversation to take a shower while Riley was telling a story. Riley‚Äôs response? ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôll just talk faster then!‚Äù She proceeded to trap Sally in the convo for another 15 minutes, making Sally almost late to work. \n\n\n- when she‚Äôs nervous/anxious she will go on tangents and won‚Äôt let anyone else speak until her tangent is complete. And I‚Äôm talking usually looonng tangents, at lightning talking speed. \n\n- She‚Äôs a bad listener. \n\n- Whenever she hears my girlfriend come out of her room she comes out a few seconds later and tries to act like she came out by coincidence. She then traps my girlfriend in conversation. \n\n- She trauma dumps on my girlfriend almost every single day. It‚Äôs like her only talking point is her vast array of mental problems. \n\n- She squeals really loud whenever she sees something she likes on TV. Or when she hears crazy-ish news. Or just randomly. Abs just squeals a lot. \n\n\nDan: \n\nDan is a chill stoner. He‚Äôs not emotional, easy going, and is aware of others‚Äô boundaries. He‚Äôs a good roommate. \n\nRiley & I‚Äôs Relationship: \n\nAs you can probably tell, I can‚Äôt stand Riley. \n\nI decided early on that I don‚Äôt want to engage with her beyond niceties. I‚Äôm a full time computer science student and most of my classes are online, so I‚Äôm stuck with Riley in the house all day (my laptop is broken so I have to use my desktop). I actively avoid her by never leaving my office and never, ever strike up a conversation with her. I want to establish that we are simply acquaintances, not friends. \n\nI took this a little too far one time, though. One time when I left the house, Riley says ‚ÄúBe safe!‚Äù, which I completely ignore and don‚Äôt give a response to. As a result, Riley cries HARD to Sally & assumes I hate her (I do, but I don‚Äôt want her to think that). Hopefully this situation gives you insight to how emotionally unstable this girl is. \n\nOne time I got high & hyper focused on Riley‚Äôs tangent & cringed so hard I had to leave the room. \n\nDan & I‚Äôs Relationship:\n\nI‚Äôve been busy with finals the past 2 weeks, so I haven‚Äôt really gotten to spend time with Dan, but I think I know him well enough. I honestly wouldn‚Äôt care if I negver saw him again in my life. I‚Äôm neutral to him. \n\nSally‚Äôs and Riley‚Äôs Relationship:\n\nSally doesn‚Äôt like Riley either. She feels that Riley sucks up her energy, annoys her, and makes her home uncomfortable. \n\nBut Sally is still extremely nice to Riley, to a fault. Sally used to work in senior care and hospice, so she knows how to treat even the worst of patients with kindness, and tends to go above and beyond in doing so. In my opinion, she treats Riley like a hospice patient. And needless to say, Riley thinks Sally and her are close friends, which is 100% not the case. \n\nSally‚Äôs and Dan‚Äôs Relationship: \n\nSally and Dan are genuine buds. Their friendship is why Dan & Riley started living with us in the fist place. Sally & Dan work at the same place, usually during the same shift. \n\nSally & I‚Äôs Opinion on Riley: \n\nIt feels like Sally and I are babysitting someone‚Äôs kid all day. Worse, an attention starved kid. \n\nFor my girlfriend, it‚Äôs like a never ending slumber party with only the kid your mom made you invite. \n\nProblem:\n\nRiley has sucked all peace out of our home. Whenever we want to leave our room, she‚Äôs there, and starts talking a mile a minute. And because she‚Äôs always at home, we can never feel\nat ease in our own home. \n\nProposal 1 & Question 1:\n\nBecause Dan & Riley haven‚Äôt signed the lease yet and haven‚Äôt paid any bills, we want to them to move out. But how do we go about telling them this without destroying fragile Riley (I think this will break her) or making Sally‚Äôs work environment awkward? \n\nProposal 2 & Question 2: \n\nWe should just somehow make our living situation easier to live with. But how would we go about doing this?"

                "body": "Hey everybody! A little background story, me (21F) and my best friend (20F) have been best friends since high school, and we've always been there for each other and we talked every single day. But as we both grew older, it got more difficult for me to keep up with our daily phone calls.\n\nYou see, she likes to talk with me for hours on the phone everyday, usually about random stuff about her day, and of course I would tell her about my own day but it was mainly her talking since she was the chattier between the two of us. I like our phone calls, and knowing that she wants to talk with me everyday.\n\nSo what's the problem? Well, I got a job that is a 9 to 5 job, and even though I really like it there, I feel drained at the end of the day that all I want to do is go home, take a shower, have dinner and watch some tv before going to sleep. At first I would be able to talk to my bsf with our daily phone calls despite my exhaustion, it even got to points where I would fall asleep in middle of our calls due to how tired I was, it was more than on one occasion.\n\nA few months ago, I had a really rough week at work and I would be super tired after each day, so I ignored my bsf's calls everyday for that week, I didn't even send her a message saying why I basically ignored her, but in my defence she never messaged me either to ask what's going on. \n\nEventually the week was over and I answered her call the next day, and she asked me what was going on, and I said that I just had a rough week and was just tired. And she told me that she also had a rough week and joked that her coworkers now hate me. I asked her what she meant by that, and she told me how she told her coworkers how her bsf was ignoring her and not caring about her whatsoever. At the time, I felt like shit for not being there for her, so I just laughed uncomfortbly as she continued to joke about it and I apologized.\n\nAbout two weeks later, I had another rough day at work, so to avoid what happened last time, I sent her a text in advance that I was tired and wouldn't be able to talk to her on the phone that night and that I still love and care about her. She still tried to call me, but I assumed that she just didn't see my message so I ignored her calls and went to bed. I woke up the next morning to a text from my bsf, that basically said that she is tired of me not putting efforts into our friendship and that she also has a job but still manages to make time for our friendship. I got mad and wrote back that I do value our friendship and that I was just tired and it didn't have anything to do with \"making time for our friendship\". I admit, I wasn't nice in my message, and that I released some frustration on her from all the stress I had at work, but she wasn't exactly kind in her message either. I didn't get a message back and after a few hours I deleted my message out of guilt that it would hurt her, I honestly don't know if she read the message or not. \n\nFast forward to a few weeks later, this is the part I feel the most guilt about, I ignored her completely through out those weeks, I didn't answer her calls nor her texts. Eventually her birthday came, and I decided that despite what happened I would still send her a birthday message, so after I finished my workday, I sent her a small text wishing her a happy birthday and that I still love and care about her. She answered, and I quote \"nice of you to remember...\" I was so upset at her response that I didn't reply and continued to ignore her. At that point, she didn't call everyday, but she did try at least a few times a week.\n\nGuess what? My birthday also came after about a month, and I never got a birthday text from her, which hurt a bit but I just shrugged because what could I do? And I was the one ghosting her so I shouldn't be hurt by that. I did get a text from her a day after, asking if I wanted to attend her christmas party. My birthday was in September, she asked me three months in advance if I wanted to come to a party a day after my birthday. Felt like it was her way of saying, I remembered it was your birthday, I just didn't care. I ignored that message as well. She stopped completely calling me at that point, and I was glad that she got the hint that I needed distance.\n\nI got a text from her recently asking if I \"want to fix our friendship or do I not care anymore?\". It feels wrong to continue to ghost her, but I don't know what to do at this point. What do you think should I do?\n\nTLDR: my bsf thinks that me being tired from a workday and not talking to her everyday equals to me not caring about our friendship, so I decided to take a break from our friendship without telling her. Should I try fixing this? Or should I just break off our friendship at this point?"

Also my bad it's not marriage I asked her to be my girlfriend... I'm sorry guys! \n\nI met a girl almost 2 months ago, and we went on a few dates. Then I officially proposed to her about becoming my girlfriend, and she said yes. Just a week ago she started dry texting me and I felt like she was getting cold. She has a really busy schedule where she goes diving, has lab classes, works on a presentation and more. She gets really exhausted, she has told me in the past. I got super mad and texted her a lot of things saying stuff like why can't you just give me a 10-min call, And then she went off on me and told me that she has serious depression issues where she has thought about self harm, She also told me that's why she can't find to give me time because she can't even handle herself so how will she be able to deal with me. I felt really bad as didnt knew all of this, She told me that couldnt pick up all the hints when she used to say \"im exhausted\" and am immature as well as self centered, later that night i serached about the things which people who deal with issuses like these will do to their close ones. She also sent me some screenshots where she mentioned about the people acting cold towards the close people because they feel numb and exhausted when going through all this... I felt like i understand what she is going through, But i felt like if she is exhausted then how come she is able to post instagram stories and cant reply to me about how is she doing... she posts stories about regular stuff and here i felt like she was too cold to me all of a sudden. She has never publicaly posted me....she only posted me once in close friends because she told me she is a very private person however she has around 500 followers... I overthink a lot and in the past two of my girlfriends never posted me online just like now however when we ended our relationship they posted the other guys online one week in never used to care about all this but because of that felt betrayed and i think a lot about it now.i dont wanna be like this but she also posted a picture of herself scuba diving in some sort of a revealing outfit.. there was  the other guy there who was dressed up in a sult for diving and was surfing which makes me think of the worse things  and she posted the image she clicked of that guy in close friends too. It makes me feel inescure and reminds me about mypast experience which have discussed with here as well however dont want to ask all these questions because I feel like it will turn into an argument. rarely massege her as much as I used to these days and am trying to not contact here and give her the space since she has talked to me about all the depression she is going thru.. and I don't want to act clingy. everytime I  bring up  something I get called on being self centered and not thoughtfull enough and if I try to ask her to call me up for 5 min then she would say she dont have the time to think of herself so how would she be able to think of me amidst all of this. She currently goes to a far away because their school requires them to perform practicals on coral reefs for which she is constantly traveling and feel exhausted. I want to improve myself and become more understanding but I feel like I have lost the balance in the relationship and my value has gone down but I still love her.. and I'd like to do the right thing so pls I would require some sincere advice if possible."

We've been dating for 3 years now, so we're used to this and it doesn't normally cause a problem. Charlie is spending Christmas with his family, but they have been constantly nagging him about where I am and why I \"never come over\" for holiday events. I did visit and meet his family for the first time during two holiday events just before COVID, even though this meant that I had to skip seeing my own family on those days in order to do so. That was before I started grad school, so I lived at home with my parents and they understood that I was going to meet his family. His family were all very pleasant and I was happy to meet everyone. Now since I haven't seen my family in a while though, I really just want to spend time with them. We're a very small family (4 individuals) but really close to one another, so I know that they've missed me. On the opposite site, Charlie comes from a very big family, and their gatherings are usually around 20 people. Even though his cousin extended the invitation to their holiday events over the past couple years, I respectfully declined and explained that I wouldn't be participating in any large gatherings due to COVID. I got the sense that they weren't really happy about it, but had to accept it nonetheless. COVID isn't the main reason this time, so they've now been more insistent than ever and I feel like I'm being judged pretty harshly.\n\nDuring a recent family gathering, Charlie told me that his mom and cousin started essentially gossiping about me and why I \"never come to any family holidays.\" Some things that were said were kind of mean and petty, in my opinion. Don't they understand that I have my own family to be with on holidays too? Charlie told me this out of frustration, because he wasn't happy to hear the gossip either and had to jump in to stop it. To be clear, his parents have never actually invited me anywhere, holiday or not. All the invitations came from his cousin since the events are always at his house and nowhere else. Charlie actually wanted to have just the two of us and his parents together for a nice dinner sometime last year so we can get to know each other better, but his parents refused to have the dinner at their actual house because it's apparently too messy. So, we met at Charlie's college apartment instead during that time, and his parents drove over an hour to get there. His parents have never actually invited me over because of their supposedly messy house, but his mom assumes that the cousin inviting me over his house for Christmas counts as her invitation too because she's part of the family. Charlie currently lives back home with his parents for the time being, and has even said that they would have to clean his parents' house before I would ever be invited over because of how bad it is. I'm a very clean person in general and I know that Charlie has told his parents, so I think the reason is that they might feel embarrassed to have me over. He has been over my parents' house for dinner many times since I lived at home before grad school, so he knows my parents pretty well and knows that my family is also quite clean.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that his mom and cousin gossiped about and judged me for not coming to their holiday parties, assuming that I \"don't want to be part of their family\". When I tried to tell them that I want to spend Christmas with my own family, the response they gave was that I should just bring my entire family over the cousin's house since we don't have that many people anyway. She seems to think \"the more the merrier,\" and that's not the way that my family is. His family doesn't seem to understand that I just want to spend Christmas Day with my own family.\n\nCharlie and I have set up a different day for us and friends to go out for dinner, exchange gifts, and spend time together. This is our way of celebrating the season so we can each be with our respective families during actual Christmas Day. As much as I love and care for him though, I'm finding that his family and I aren't very compatible in the way we think or do things. He said that he's going to try and talk with his mom and cousin to impose some more boundaries and that gossiping about me will not be tolerated and is just going to drive me away. The two of us get along very well and he thinks more similarly to the way that I do rather than his other family members, but this whole situation has me very scared as I know there are other examples of how his some of his family members and I have not always had the same mindset. We each love our families very much as well, so I wouldn't ever want either one of us to give up our respective families. What does it mean for our relationship if his family and I just aren't compatible with each other?\n\nTLDR: My (26F) boyfriend's (26M) large family has been nagging him about why I \"never come over\" his cousin's house for holiday events, even though I went to two holiday gatherings in the past and couldn't go to any others for the past couple years due to COVID. I started grad school last year and haven't seen my family in a while, so I really just want to spend Christmas with them this year and my BF's family doesn't understand. His mom and cousin recently gossiped about and judged me pretty harshly, even though his parents have never invited me over their actual place on account of their house being too messy. My BF broke up the gossip and is going to try and impose more boundaries to prevent them gossiping about me again. We each love our families very much and I'd never want to bring anyone apart.

I‚Äôm also the youngest (29 F) besides my cousin‚Äôs two little kids, but they aren‚Äôt relevant to my story. \n\nI want some reassurance, advise or insight. üò≠\n\nI moved across the country in March.  I broke my leg and had to get it nailed back on, and then both my mom and my aunt kicked me out of their homes when I asked to convalesce there. My mom demanded to control my post-op prescriptions and I disagreed, and my aunt‚Äôs husband was verbally and emotionally abusive toward me. So that‚Äôs how I landed with my cousin (36M) and his family who I just love. But they are in a very different phase of life than me‚Ä¶ and it makes me feel a little isolated.\n\nI started dating a guy (30M) in July around the time when I could barely start walking unassisted.  It was really fun and pretty quickly he asked me to date him exclusively.  Flash forward to November: I took a weeklong trip back to where I had moved from to see all my closets friends just before Thanksgiving.  Upon returning to my cousin‚Äôs house‚Ä¶ I started to have this feeling that Guy-I‚Äôm-Dating was‚Ä¶ turned off by me somehow? I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it. \n\nI knew how busy he was between finishing his second bachelors and working full time, so I tried not to let my feelings of missing him get mixed up with this ‚Äúoff feeling.‚Äù  Also I definitely understand being busy and being unreachable.  I was on active duty in the military for 10 years before I broke my leg.  It‚Äôs pretty normal for me, my friends, or the people we‚Äôre dating to give a heads up that they‚Äôll be off the grid for days, weeks, or months, at a time and we just have to wait for them to come back up on the net.  However‚Ä¶ there was 3 particular things that just gave me a bad vibe.  I‚Äôm going to try to explain them objectively so maybe someone can tell me if I misinterpreted them or give me some more insight. \n\n1) Sometimes it wasn‚Äôt far out of my way to pick up a smoothie/coffee and bring to his office.  Some days I would call him in advance to see if he‚Äôd like anything and if he‚Äôd have time to pop out and collect a treat and so I could see him for a few minutes during this busy time.   A few times he said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs really nice of you but don‚Äôt do it if it‚Äôs out of your way.‚Äù  This confused me a lot because we both understood it was definitely a convenient thing for me to do and that‚Äôs why I was offering‚Ä¶ also I wanted to encourage him while he was working and see him.  On one of these occasions I told him ‚ÄúI thought maybe this would be met with more enthusiasm‚Ä¶ do you still want to date me?‚Äù  To which he said yes. \n\n2) when we finally got a chance to get a dinner together on a Friday night, afterwards I told him ‚ÄúI feel like something is off, and when I don‚Äôt hear from you for days at a time, I get really spun up about it.‚Äù  To which he said, ‚Äúmake yourself more busy so you think about it less.‚Äù \n\n3) That weekend, I happened to be really busy, so there was not much correspondence.  However, 5 days went by since we had that dinner and I didn‚Äôt hear anything from him. Not a text, not a call, nothing.  I couldn‚Äôt help but listen to my gut, so I drove to his office, asked to the key to his place, collected my things and dropped his off.  When I made it back to his office to return the key I asked all the questions.  ‚Äúwhat happened? Did you just get bored? Did someone die? Did your phone break? Did you get hurt? Did something happen I should know about?‚Äù  To this he said, ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôve just been busy.‚Äù I said ‚Äúyou can say anything you want to to me‚Äù to which he just shrugged.  I said, ‚Äúok. It was really fun to date you. Goodbye.‚Äù\n\nSince then I sent one text, saying how I was really confused that things fizzled out the way they did because I previously thought of him as a straight shooter.  I also said his lack of communication hurt me because it made me feel like a play thing and not a person- like someone he just uses for entertainment when he‚Äôs bored and not so busy. And I haven‚Äôt heard a thing back. I know the text was delivered‚Ä¶ who knows if he read it but let‚Äôs say he did‚Ä¶ should that validate the vibe I was getting since I returned from my trip?\n\nWould love any and all insight. I‚Äôm concerned I missed a signal and maybe ended something good prematurely or unnecessarily."

                "body": "Me (22f) and my boyfriend (24m) had been together for a wonderful 5 years. A few weeks ago my boyfriend decided that we shouldn't be together anymore because his mom doesn't want us to. I've only met his mom a few times and his mom never liked me much. She had apparently called me mean names to a mutual friend \"D\" of my mom and her (not knowing D is closer to my mom). This happened 3 years ago and when I brought this up with my boyfriend, he refused his mom would say such things. I trusted him because its his mom afterall and he would know her better. I still asked him to talk about our relationship with her muptiple times after that. He said that his mom would understand and that he doesnt want to put a strain on the relationship until we start planning our wedding. I only occasionally brought it up but he would just divert the topic. Note that my mom isnt supportive of my relationship either (because of the name calling and other things she heard about his mom) but I had told her firmly that I'm not gonna give up this because he has been good to me all these years. Me and my mom both maintain a strained but civil relationship now. \n\nSo about a little more than a month ago, my boyfriend went to visit his parents for a weekend (he works in a different state- we were maintaining an LDR for 2 years because he had to move for work). When he came back from his place, he texted he wants us to not be together because he doesnt want to hurt his mom anymore. I was shattered and the following few days was me trying to tell him that we could sit down and talk about it to which he kept saying he doesnt want to continue as a couple but he still wants to be a friend. I took a break from talking to him because 1. Everyone in my family had become sick and I had to take care of them 2. I was emotionally drained after trying to talk sense into him for 2 weeks. After a couple weeks, his friend contacted me saying he's in a bad place and that I need to talk with him. I called him and told him again that we could talk this through and if he still wants to break up I'll be okay with it. The reason I repeatedly wanted to talk this through was that never once have we not communicated our issues with eachother. It ends up with us trying to be better and having the issue solved. That always works because we both try to be what we promised (eg: be more understanding of eachother's schedules and arranging our own schedule so we could catch up atleast a few minutes a day). Communicating would also help me understand if there is any other reason for the breakup.\n\nHe refused talking together again and I got mad. I called him a chicken for not living his own life because his mom doesnt like it and that him letting opinions of others influence his life would leave him with a lot of regrets. He said that he cant do this anymore being between me and his mom. So I said I'm done and that he is now free of that dilemma and left. That was the last interaction we had (it happened about a week ago).\n\nI dont really want to break things up and I dont know what to do right now. We've been each other's confidants and best friends for all these years and it hurts me that he couldn't even tell his mom that he loves me. I'm okay with giving him a few months (I told him this and he refused this too) because he might have taken a decision in the heat of the moment.  I say this because even two days before he went to meet his parents, he was his usual loving, considerate self and we ended up talking about having our wedding by the end of the next year. \n\nWhat do I do now? Should I wait for a few more months for him to think through? Should I talk to him again? Is this the right decision?"

                "body": "Hey guys. So recently, I haven't been enjoying talking on the phone with my girlfriend as much as usual. I still enjoy it at times, but sometimes it feels like a chore (for lack of a better word) and I like quiet nights to myself sometimes when she has other things going on or she's tired. Ultimately, she doesn't have a lot of people to talk to (neither do I, but she's a far more social creature than me), so I get a lot of it. At the beginning of our relationship, I loved that. But as we get further in and the honeymoon stage is over, I need my space too. Anyways, as a result I've started to dread FaceTiming her at nights sometimes. It's driven me into multiple tailspins that maybe I don't love her anymore or something is wrong, but truthfully it's just because we do it too often. When we hang out in person, it's the best time. I first thought it's just because face to face time is always better, but as I thought about it more, it's because we don't do it every day. Problem is, she sees no problem. She would call me multiple times a day and hang out with me every day in an ideal world. Would she maybe get sick of it after awhile, yes, but that isn't the point. We just have different ideas of what constitutes the right amount of time to spend together, and have different needs. And that's started to expand to phone time. She's having a hard time with the holidays here for some personal reasons so I feel bad wanting to bring this up to her and take her away from time that makes her happy, but I also don't want to sacrifice my own enjoyment in this relationship. And I don't want to never talk to her on the phone, I just ideally would want to FaceTime maybe 3-4 times a week instead of every day. I just don't know how she'd take that with everything else in mind, and like I said, it is a serious disruption of our norm. Do I bring it up now, leave it alone for until after the holidays (two weeks from now essentially), or see if anything just changes on its own? I don't know. The night time has just always been \"our time\" because she sleeps much later in the mornings (or we're in school), my afternoons (and often hers too) are busy, and it leaves is the night as \"our time\". But sometimes I want it to be my time too. Is there some kind of compromise I could reach?"

Emily had 2 cats already when we moved in, I brought my one and Rey ended up taking one in we found in the parking lot in the cold in October. All was well for a while Emily‚Äôs room stunk here and there but I didn‚Äôt say anything because we all had a really busy and stressful semester where we all weren‚Äôt at the apartment at the same time. Problems started arising after Rey took in the kitten we found. \n\nThe kitten originally belonged to someone in the apartment complex that told us she no longer wanted the kitten (ok asshole don‚Äôt abandon it outside though). Rey felt ‚Äúbonded‚Äù to the kitten for 3 days and decided to keep her but after realizing the tasks and upkeep that comes with she slowly changed her tune. She began closing her door keeping the kitten from being able to go in her room so it was constantly eating  all mine and Emily‚Äôs cat food while also not being properly potty trained so having accidents in our rooms. This went on for about a month where we had enough of the costs we were putting in to take care of HER kitten so we had an intervention with her.\n\nRey agreed to leave her door open and to take into consideration our suggestions on how properly care for a kitten. That went well for maybe 3 days before the smell\nBecame noticeable. It seeped into the living room and anytime me and Emily hang out there we are constantly hit with the putrid smell of cat pee and poop. Meanwhile\nEmily‚Äôs room is also giving off a similar scent to which she must be nose blind to. I find myself wanting to barf the second I walk in to the apartment because it‚Äôs so bad.\n\nI have had cats my whole life and consider myself to be a good owner. I scoop the items out of the litter box when I wake up and get home every night, place food out at every meal, replace the water dish everyday, give treats and cuddles you name it. However I guess this is not normal to scoop cats litter daily?? I investigated their rooms since I am looking after the cats while they are away during Christmas break and found their litter boxes over flowing with poop and pee to the point the cats have done it on the floor next to the box.\n\nI am disgusted and horrified by what I saw and am so angry they could let their cats use those boxes. I have been thinking about putting in a formal complaint to the front office because it smells horrible and they don‚Äôt deserve their cats if they will continue to treat them this way. However I‚Äôd like to do  a similar intervention to talk to them about the smell before I make a complaint but i dont know how to bring it up without sounding like an entitled Karen who knows what‚Äôs best for cats. \n\nThis is a serious issue and I don‚Äôt want to do it over text but I hate confrontation.. any help would be appreciated greatly \n\nTLDR: Roomates aren‚Äôt cleaning up their cat‚Äôs litter box it is stinking up the whole apartment how  do I confront bthem without coming off as insulting?"

                "body": "I (24F) have been having problems with a few co-workers (23F, 35M) at my job. One is my supervisor, another is a employee who is a 35 year old male.\n\nTo start off, when I first started working at this particular job, I had a strange feeling about my male co-worker. He was extra nice and everyone liked him. I caught him creeping on me a couple of times and he also gave me weird vibes whenever I was around him.\n\nOne night he was particularly flirting with me and I thought \"hey this guy is actually nice, he's asking a lot of questions about myself\". \n\nThen one day one of my other co-workers and I were talking and she told me that the male co-worker and her were sleeping with each other and had some sort of relation with one another. I was surprised because he is about 15 years older than her. \n\nHe started flirting with me intensely. He was always around me and always being extra nice to me. He's very experienced at the job and so I would always go to him for help as well. \n\nOne day my co-worker who told me that this particular guy and her were having a relation with another told me he was a jerk. She confirmed that he was married and had a child, in which he never told her about. She was also convinced that he was having a relationship with another young girl at my job (lets call her Kali) I ignored her because she was saying a lot of things and she was very emotional. I couldn't have the conversations she was trying to have with me in the workplace, but I tried to be supportive.\n\nShe ended up having a lot of mental issues and went to one of the managers and explained the situation. She almost got him fired, and the guy told my managers that he was getting a divorce from his wife. I still kind of liked him after all of that because he was very charming and attractive. He went on leave.\n\nHe ended coming back about 6 months ago. He pursued me even harder. Sometimes getting inches away from me. People who were around thought that he was my husband, or incited that we were \"together\". He would say side comments, and it felt sexual. At times I really did feel uncomfortable because I felt like I had no choice to not be flirty because of just how close he got to me and the questions he would ask.\n\nThe \"Kali\" girl is my supervisor. All of the sudden they started to spend alot of time together. Everyone continued to have their suspicions about the two of them. During this time he still flirted with me, just not when she was there. I started to notice this pattern and started to see the situation for what it was.\n\nThe worst part of this situation is that my supervisor (Kali) who was my co-worker isn't treating me like she used to.  She micromanages what I do and It seems that everything I do is wrong. Every time she is in front of him or when he is there she'll either talk down to me or be super nice to me which I find weird.\n\nAnd if he sees me he'll treat me like he has never done before. He'll either say something to get under my skin, or he'll be cold to me. Which I don't really care about. I would much rather have him treat me like another person than to flirt with me.\n\nAnother bad part is that whenever my supervisor is not around he'll find me in the workplace and almost \"stalk\" me, trying to get my attention. He'll get very close to me, or walk past me alot. I honestly feel very scared in this situation because there is so much tension. I have been trying to ignore him and not engage with him at all.\n\n. I don't know why my supervisor is acting like this..  if it's because the male co-worker and her have a thing going or if its because shes new to management.  It's strange because she also has been more aggressive towards me ever since I stopped engaging with my male co-worker. \n\nToday I had enough of it and got upset and talked to two of my other co-workers about it.\n\nI don't want to be apart of it, and I'm getting a lot of ill feelings and dissonance from this situation. My other co-workers tell me to talk to a manager, but how do I even explain. I don't want to get anyone fired and I also don't want anyone to think that I'm making this up in my head. I could be, but it feels to real in my instincts. \n\nI don't know what to do, but I just want my supervisor to treat me well again and for my male co- worker to give me space and not be around me all the time when my supervisor is not there.\n\nIs this a situation that anyone else experienced?\n\nTLDR: Somehow I feel like I am part of love triangle at my job that I don't even want to be part of and I am getting reprehended for it from my own supervisor because the guy is a known jerk."

We watch a lot of livestreams on twitch. We met through our favorite streamer. We also watch a good bit of youtube and other entertainment such as shows and video games together.\n\nWhen a girl happens to go on screen, she's expressed that she doesn't want me to look. Whether it's a random video/clip a streamer is watching or a character on screen. \n\nI've desperately tried to express that I'm not that type of guy. Just because a girl is on screen, that doesn't automatically mean I want to f*ck her. I legitimately think my girlfriend is the most beautiful girl on this planet and I try my best to remind her of that every day. She has a lot of self-confidence issues, she views herself as the bottom of the barrel, no good, disgusting ogre. I know helping her see herself how I see her won't happen within a day or week. This takes months and years of self-image battles. I feel like this feeds into her jealousy of other girls. \n\nWe've had three talked when this sort of thing happens and what she expresses is how she doesn't want me to be looking at girls who are scantily dressed or provocative. I completely agree, I wouldn't even remotely do that to begin with because I'm extremely committed to her and only her. I try to express that I don't look at girls that way, I just see them as \"oh a person is doing something on screen\". If it's something obviously provocative or sexual then absolutely I'll do something else such as look at my phone or whatever. But something such as a character or a clip of a girl streamer playing a game and something funny happens... she has the same expectation. I have a strong feeling she's generalizing me with other guys who watch livestreams who are constantly oogling over girls. I started watching twitch back in 2016 because I love games. Not because I want to see softcore p*rn. \n\nI don't know how else to help her through her jealousy and development of poor body image. I won't give up on her, it is getting sad and upsetting to witness."

                "body": "This is a close friend of mine. I want to help her, so I am writing here to see what your opinion is: \n\nHubby 47, wife 47, married 27 years. Hubby has a history of a bad temper. It's not often. Usually once a year but when it happens, it is horrible. The most recent was because wife was upset at him for leaving the kids at at a very important work event of wife until 9pm. He could've gone home anytime. He pressured her to leave, and she snapped saying he could go at any time. They had two cars, they lived a mile away from the event. The kids were passed out asleep and she didn't appreciate him keeping there the entire time. He lost it. She left with hubby, but he was pissed. First, he refused to drive the vehicle because he wanted to argue. Wife was tired, very and just wanted to go home. She asked him to go home, he refused. She got out of vehicle and walked back to closed building. He pulled vehicle in the front, stayed park. She knew he wouldn't leave until she came to vehicle. The kids were in the back seat (They are four and five years old). So she got in the vehicle. On the way home, she didn't say a word to him but he ranted. She told him that he was ramping himself up and to please stop. He got worse.  They got home, he said he would give his kids a shower and for her to leave the house. She began to leave until he turned to one of the kids and said momma is leaving because she doesn't care about you. So wife has to stay - what else is she going to do? She is so tired, she isn't saying anything or fighting. He gets up in her face and tells her what a bitch and other words. He pushes her toward the wall. She holds up her hands and says \"I'm not touching you\" He backs off, and then he walks passed her, using his shoulder to push her again. \n\nWife walks out with hubby to the car outside, she opens the passenger door to ask him not to leave, he tells her to f - off. Peels out of the driveway damaging the grass and leaving skid marks in the driveway, it's so violent, the passenger door shuts on its own. He is gone for the night. A charge of $150 of a local hotel appears on their bank account.\n\nThe next day, wife has to work and is thankful their son is home to babysit the kids because hubby is still not home. She goes and gets donuts and returns home to find hubby has returned but is no where to be seen. Wife drops of donuts and goes to work another 12 hour shift. At 7pm, son shows up with box of cold pizza leftovers. He is about to leave but says that they are going to walk around a minute during the event. Wife has a break, so she wanted to go with the kids. Hubby is cold and distant. Afterward, wife returns to work. When wife gets home, hubby is on the couch. Not a word. He is flying out of town in the morning. Wife is supposed to take him to the airport an hour away, leaving at 4am. It's midnight when she goes to bed, but doesn't sleep well due to the early morning departure. Hubby gets up, takes a shower, and doesn't say anything. Wife asks if he still needs a ride. He says no, he has a ride.\n\nHubby leaves. Wife has to find out if kids are going to church with grandma (his mother) in the morning. She texts grandma to find out that hubby was told to tell wife that there is church. He said nothing. Wife later gets in vehicle to find engine codes popping. Hubby didn't tell her about that either. Hubby left the living room and kitchen looking like a frat party happened the night before - it took two days to clean it.\n\nHubby texts \"landed in XYZ\" and for two weeks, texts things like that. Wife doesn't respond. Finally, a week before Hubby is due home for Christmas, Wife writes and says that she feels disrespected, unloved, and doesn't know what to do.\n\nHubby says he was \"attacked\" by wife. She twist everything to make him the bad guy. He left because wife needed space. He never said anything ugly to the girls. He got a car and slept on the couch because he didn't want to bother wife after working long hours. The house is always a mess and they need to fix that. He said he perceived is a bully because he is a big guy (he is 6'5\", 290lbs). Didn't matter that he is actually physical. (Wife is 5'7\" 140 pounds) He says that wife is always playing the victim, that wife is the abuser. That she always attacks him with her words and even is attacking him by the messaging that she feels disrespected. He put out the olive branch with the cold leftover pizza and invited wife to go walking with them. (Note, he never invited her anywhere, she just decided to go) She had been in her office, he had been outside, sent son in to give her pizza. He said that he assumed wife knew about the codes so need to tell her about them. (Note: hubby knows a lot about cars and usually fixes them).\n\nImportant to note. Hubby never picked up the phone to call, not even once. When wife pointed this out he said \"he hates phone calling for something that can be texted.\" He now says he isn't coming home for Christmas because he is done with being treated poorly. Wife said it was another punishment but he put \"LOL. You. Punished. Enjoy your perfect life.\"\n\nWife says, most of the time hubby is sweet, caring, and loving. He works hard and provides for the family well. He is a loving father. But this has happened at least 30 times in their marriage, I keep telling her it is abusive and she needs to leave him, but she doesn't believe me. What do you think?"

We lived about 1.5hrs apartment, no cars, so we would book hotels to spend time together.\n\nWe‚Äôve had issues escalating to physical violence throughout our relationship (still argue quite a bit, basically everyday). At the start, I was working and absolutely loved my job, I went out with friends and family regularly and maintained good relationships with them, gym regularly. Basically I was extremely happy with my life considering after struggling myself I was finally headed in the right direction.\n\nHe was honest and wasn‚Äôt in the best place (wasn‚Äôt working, mental health, previous addiction)‚Ä¶ I knew what it felt like to be alone, after coming out of depression again so I was always supportive however I could be. At times he would rely on me too much (having to juggle family responsibilities, work, uni, caring for mother and social life) making me pull away. Then it leads to a fight because I‚Äôm not ‚Äúthere for him‚Äù or ‚Äúunsupportive‚Äù\n\nAdditional Info: I have a low sex drive, (slightly concerning üòÇ), insecure, he wants to have sex everyday! and pretty much demands it (‚Äúit‚Äôs your duty to please your man‚Äù, ‚Äújust play with it‚Äù or he‚Äôll just keep pressing himself against me (if I‚Äôm not in the mood, yuck!) Which has caused a lot of fights and I can understand being turned down can hurt especially repetitively. I have definitely just done it for him sometimes bc of feeling guilty about not having a higher sex drive or not meeting his needs. Now I‚Äôm over it and no means no, idc how much your balls hurt!!\n\nOutings: I experience a little anxiety, he says his is severe anxiety and in the past he gets very easily irritated by anyone and almost anything which makes dates hard!!, we can‚Äôt have a good time. he walks ahead of me and says I walk so slow, I always feel like he‚Äôll find a way to end the date (start a fight, drag his feet, yawn or just complain!). When I vocalise these things he says it‚Äôs to cope with his anxiety?? Sounds like lies but he‚Äôll breakdown and almost cry sometimes so I think I‚Äôm being unsupportive \n\nNow:\nFast forward ‚Äî>> through to; various ups & downs, fights, almost-break ups. He‚Äôs got his own place(which is great but basically wants me to live here) There‚Äôs been a lot of animosity between us, when we fight we just sit in separate rooms, we haven‚Äôt been out on a nice date in so long, spend most of our time high, he‚Äôll play Xbox while I just sit on my phone and exist around him.

He enjoys having power/control and will always say things like (‚Äúyou‚Äôre in my place, ‚Äúwho‚Äôs paying/paid for it‚Äù) & will make sly comments implying that he‚Äôs doing better than me.

Doesn‚Äôt respect/understand the responsibility I have with my family (immigrant parents and sick parent) \n- He‚Äôs sexist and misogynistic, very shocking because his mum is super sweet, he always seems to always talk about how women ‚Äúshould & shouldn‚Äôt act‚Äù, he says when men cheat it‚Äôs just sex?\n- says I‚Äôm trying to compete with him ever since he got a job?? Not like I just want to make myself and family proud\n\nEveryone around me is getting so impatient and have expressed their concerns about the relationship holding me back and have witnessed some of the toxic behaviour.

I have been thinking all day about how I have been single for a couple years, how so many problems in my life are lack of confidence, self esteem, and fear of rejection, which is why I have been single for about 2 years now.\n\nI want to reconnect with her, maybe not necessarily ask her out, but maybe to start as friends, but the only way I could do that is through email, because for our school emails all you need to do is type their name in. I have no other way of contacting her, I don't have her number or snap or anything. Would I be overstepping, perhaps being a creep by emailing her something like \"hey it's me ____ from graduation earlier. I enjoyed talking with you today, it made commencement a bit more bareable. If you're ever in [my town] again soon, and want to hang out (?) here's my number\"\n\nPlease let me know, if I'm nuts for thinking about doing this, or if I should let it go and move on. I really am leaning towards trying to be someone different for once and actually message her. Thank you for reading."

They share good communication, affection, and lifestyle, seemingly a great couple.\n\nThat is, at least, until last month. Her bf progressively began to feel more distant and to exhibit signs of depression: losing interest in what he does, staring in the void for minutes, avoiding physical contact, no interest in sex, spending lots of time alone, eats and showers scarcely, and other very unusual behaviours. Noticing this, my friend tried to tackle these changes with him several times, but he didn't open up. Rather, he either stays silent, or he becomes increasingly irritated and claims that \"nothing's wrong\". After some time, my friend managed to get a response like: \"these are my problems, you don't have to help me\".\n\nMy friend did her best to be understandable and leave him space to process his situation, while being willing and ready to help if asked. However, the contact got scarcer over time, and after a while he wrote her a message claiming that \"he is not ready for a relationship\". She was heartbroken, but she feels that this could be due to what he is going through, rather than a decision taken with a clear mind.\n\nHe hides these behaviors from family and colleagues. My friend tried to reach out to his friends and his brother, concerned for his wellbeing. Some shared her concerns and agreed to keep an eye on him, others claimed that \"he looks normal to them\". In doing this she discovered that his best friends have been cut off apparently for futile reasons.\n\nRecently, he started posting enigmatic thoughts on social media (which he rarely used before). Alarmingly, a couple of these contained references to hanging.\n\nMy friend is obviously very concerned, but she doesn't know what else she can do. He seems to be aware he has issues, but he denies them to others and likely himself too.\n\nFrom their past talks, she thinks his problems are rooted in some troubled relationships with his family. For this reason she is not sure whether talking the situation with his dad or mom could make things better or worse.\n\nIs there something else my friend can do to help her bf? Or is this really all she can do?\n\nThanks to anyone helping us thinking through this!\n\nTLDR: My friend's (F34) boyfriend (M32) is most likely suffering from depression and recently posted possibly suicidal thoughts. She tried to help him the best she can, from talking with him about it to involving his close friends and a family member, but he refuses all help. What else can she do?"

Asking for advice on how to clearly set my boundary while hopefully minimizing his embarrassment and defensive response.) \n\nMy boyfriend (late 20s M) and I (mid 20s F) have been together collectively for almost 4 years. We were together for 3 years when I broke things off, largely due to the aforementioned issue of buttcrack hygiene in the title. \n\n\nI adore him, and I understand that most people have some minor areas in their hygiene they could improve on, but this was a deal breaker for me. When I first noticed the issue, I tried calmly and kindly talking to him about it, but he would become a little defensive and incredibly hurt. The bumcrack issues would get a little better for a week, then come back full force. There was also the issue where he wouldn't wash his hands after pooping, and his hands will smell like they touched crap. I dreaded the thought of being intimate with him because I hate the crack-shaped poo stains and smelling what he had cooking in-between his cheeks the instant he took off his pants. I flinched when he touched me because I wondered if he was getting poop particles on me. Needless to say, I was no longer attracted to him and he didn't seem to be motivated enough to be more hygienic for me. We broke it off.\n\nAfter more than a year apart, we came back together, discussed our issues and started dating again. Besides this bum dilemma, we work really well together and have great chemistry and mutual love. It really seemed like his hygiene had improved, and I was happy and secure in our relationship again for several months.\n\n...Fast forward to now, being back together nearly a year. THE POOP ISSUES ARE BACK. Guys, I've *nearly* tried everything. I've left wet wipes for him in the bathroom. I've refilled his hands-soap when he runs out and hasn't refilled it. I offered to buy him a bidet. I tried to educate him that the water running over his bum in the shower does not actually clean the poop off. He's not getting the hint.\n\nBecause he's been defensive and was so hurt in the past when I bring this up, I've been putting off having another direct conversation with him. But I need to put my foot down and tell him I cannot be with him if he smells like poop all the time and leaves poop marks on the bed. I can't keep going like this, and it's unfair to him for me to just not be avoiding sex with him without explaining to him that his lack of hygiene grosses me tf out.\n\nBesides the bum issues, he really is a wonderful man. He's kind, funny, and caring. I really need advice and support for how to initiate this conversation in a way that will minimize his embarrassment and pain while still making sure I'm setting a definite boundary. If we break up, we break up... But I'd rather be as kind about it as possible."

We've been together for 7 years. This past year has been extremely difficult with financial problems, career transition, and pandemic parenting. It's also the case that we expect different levels of interaction from a relationship. My husband needs lots of alone time and I crave connection. I would never imagine not having a conversation (serious, playful, any) after kids go to bed, but it has became the default in our marriage. I was also on the job market this year and even though we never planned this, I was supposed to find the job that would determine our financial situation+location next year. My husband was feeling stuck so he took temporary jobs and didn't apply for anything he might want to do long term.\n\nI got too close to a good friend (35m also married with kids), engaging in an emotional affair. It took me 2-3 weeks to be honest with myself and admit that what I was doing was unacceptable in a mono relationship. My feelings were (and still are) very deep though. I talked to my friend about how I felt, saying this was basically an emotional affair. I then talked to my husband, who took it really well but said that I could maintain a friendship with the AP and that should be all. \n\nThis whole thing made me realize I had lost all individuality for the past couple years. I wanted to be a good mom, finish grad school, and ignored everything else that defined me or gave me pleasure in life. I became a shell of a person and now I'm coming back to myself. Even thinking about it brings tears to my eyes. \n\nI love my husband but I don't know if and how I want to stay together. I love the AP but I'm fully aware that that might as well be infatuation and dissipate quickly. I think I need time and space to figure this all out but that's hard when you have a family.

I just don't know how much of the truth it is, I don't know if it would have stopped there, she mentioned some of the thoughts that she had where she allowed herself to do it since it was her birthday, and if she kept the secret it was okay, and that the alcohol was involved, but then apparently only did oral and didn't go further because of us... It just seems like two radically different thoughts which makes me doubt the story and I don't want that lack of faith to be plaguing me.

She became single around when we started college, her feelings for me grew even stronger, and finally I stopped kidding myself and asked her if she wanted to date. She happily said yes, and it seemed like everything was set-- but then a day later she told me she'd realized she's a lesbian.\n\nI never entirely got over that whiplash, but after a little while I believed her, despite the massive crush on me she'd had for a couple years. Several years passed-- she kept dating people on and off, sometimes more than one at the same time. (Consensually, of course. She's been polyamorous for a long time.) I'd still occasionally cuddle with her, and there were moments when she flirted with me (this was in the depth of the pandemic and she didn't have the outlets she usually did) and she even basically pity-fucked me at one point. But for the most part, she wasn't interested in me. My feelings for her were very off-and-on at that point, but basically whenever I didn't have anything going on in my dating life I'd find myself pining pretty heavily for her. And she knew that. We've always been very honest with each other, which is one of the reasons I like her so much-- I even told her I loved her romantically, at one point, and that hardly put a dent in our friendship.\n\nWeeks ago, she told me she'd been thinking about her sexuality again and that she's realized she's bisexual. I may have gotten my hopes up, but I never expected her to be making out with me on my bed a couple days later, enthusiastically talking about how much she wants me. Once again, I told her I love her, and she said she loves me back. And god *damn* if that wasn't cathartic. She said she'd be my girlfriend, if I wanted. But I knew it couldn't be that simple.\n\nShe's been dating this boy for almost two years now, and they've been living together for over a year. I'd long noted the irony of my lesbian crush dating a boy, but sexuality is fluid and he's very androgynous anyway. I've never really had a conversation with him, but unlike her past relationships he really seems like a decent guy. My friend is on record as this being the best relationship she's ever had. I've always been kind of awkward around him, which I'm sure is an obvious tell to him that I'm jealous, but apparently he approves of me.\n\nI'm just so confused by this situation. She's always been polyamorous-- she said she felt compelled to love multiple people, and I can't change that. I don't care about her having sex with other people; that's not ideal for me but I'd gladly accept that as the cost of dating my best friend. But I really don't like the idea of effectively playing second fiddle to her boyfriend. I've always struggled with feeling like I'm neglected by my peers, and for a relationship I want to be someone's first choice, you know? I feel like I don't deserve anything less than that.\n\nAnd my friend's aware of that-- like I said, I really can talk to her about anything. That's why I love her. But that means, on the other hand, how the hell can I ever date anyone who's not my beautiful, sarcastic best friend who understands me better than anyone else? She's the most important person in my life besides my parents. I've always struggled at making friends, and though I've had some close calls over the years I've never been in a legitimate relationship with anyone. I hate feeling like I'm so much more reliant on her than she is on me, but no matter what happens, cutting her out of my life isn't an option. But that only makes me worry about my future prospects with others! Even when she was a lesbian, I dreaded the thought that I might be asked, \"If your best friend told you she'd date you, would you dump me?\" And I don't think I'd have a good answer for that question. And that was back then, not now, when we've been having sex and declaring our love for each other every time I come over to her place. She wants me to take her out on a \"serious\" date, and the only reason I haven't done it yet is mostly that I've been busy with schoolwork.\n\nAll I know is, if I were dating me, I'd see this situation as a *massive* red flag. But the prospect of getting over her, while knowing she likes me back, because our feelings aren't *one hundred percent the same* seems basically impossible. I always knew I'd have to get over her to date someone else, but that seemed a lot easier when I didn't think she liked me back.\n\nSo I feel stuck in this limbo, where I'm not quite dating my best friend because my feelings like I deserve better are strong enough to keep me from taking things all the way (the term she's using is that we're \"seeing\" each other). But I'm in too far deep to date anyone else. How do I get out of this knot? Thanks for reading all that.\n\n**TL;DR:** I'm in love with my best friend, who likes me back but is polyamorous and dating someone else. I don't want to be her \"other\" boyfriend, but I like her too much to get over her while knowing she likes me back."

I was too immature to understand when they started having more mental health issues, and I just never reconnected with them after we drifted apart. I don't even know what gender or name I should use to describe them so I will use they/them for this post. They present themselves as female and use their name given at birth in front of family, both immediate and extended, but they present as male and use a different name outside of that. I am aware of this and I have mentioned it to them that I am supportive of any decisions they make regarding their identity though I am unsure if they believed me. I used to be pretty outspokenly homophobic and transphobic so this would be completely understandable. It is worth noting that as far as I know, our parents are unaware of this, and the relationship between parents and sibling is more negative and strained, but not terrible, or so I thought. \n\t\n\tI knew my sibling's reddit account for a while, but I never looked through their history until now, because I don't think they are aware that I know it and it seemed like a violation of privacy. I looked for it recently, because I was wondering what pronouns they were using and what name they were going by (I am a pretty shitty sibling, i know). The posts I found are extremely disturbing and saddening, partly because I know that they don't share such information with me or the family but also because of the content. I won't delve into much detail but their posts divulge information about our parents that would probably lead me to go very low-contact or no-contact with them immediately (Physical, Verbal, Psychological Abuse, CSAM, Possibly Sexual Abuse?). But I need to talk with my sibling before I make a decision like that, which is difficult to bring up because of our very distant relationship. There are also lots of posts about some mental health, addiction, and SA/rape problems my sibling has had that I want to let them know I will talk with them about if they want, but again, my relationship with them isn't close enough to warrant that. \n\n\tWe are having a large family get-together for Christmas, but I don't want to ask my sibling about it them, since they will be away from any support groups and probably be in a very high-stress situation being surrounded by family. How should I go about letting my sibling know that I saw their reddit posts and need to talk about it ASAP even though I almost never talk to them normally?"

I decided to induce vomiting to prevent the overdose from being fatal but it messed up some plumbing. What happened after that was unclogging a toilet and cleaning a ton of puke water while being completely incoherent. My dad and sister were incredibly angry with me. My mom was out of state until the day after and was also upset with me. They also took issue with my sort of partner T (22F) because she has some serious mental health problems of her own and my sister thought she puked and messed up the plumbing (which wasn't even close to what happened.\n\nI didn't want them to know about the attempt at the time because I really don't have time to be hospitalized but they obviously figured it out. Anyway I spoke to my mom on the phone the other day and a lot of what she said has me very anxious. My sister thinks my mom is too lenient with me, this incident included which while terrible isn't me 'getting away'  with anything. She also doesn't want T coming with me even though I'm spending Christmas eve with her family and it'd make more sense for her to come with me (she doesn't want to spend christmas with her family and driving her back home is too much driving). \n\nShe said she really just wants time with just me but that makes me feel even more scared. She also thinks my relationship is coming between me and them like a previous abusive relationship I was in but thr difference is T doesn't have a problem with my family at all whereas my abuser hated them for no reason. I've been met with more hostility than concern and compassion over my episode. I feel like going there by myself is a recipe for a full on meltdown and I just don't feel comfortable with it at all.

                "body": "So pretty much as the title says, my FWB got a girlfriend and I am sad lol. \n\nWe started talking in Nov 2021 and it was on and off since then. I didn't like him in that way initially as I was moving to a diff state and just honestly wasnt interested AT ALL. Ofc I ended up liking him eventually lol which was around July.\n\nFast forward to that time in July, he \"ended\" things with me because I pretty much accused him of lying about his home life when he told me that he was going through something. (I'll take the heat for this one). I started liking him around this time so I reached out to him after about 2 weeks of him dumping me and told him. To which he replied, \"I like you, but I dont want to talk to you.\" That was that and I literally didnt press that anymore because that wasn't enough and he wasn't interested so I left him alone. \n\nA month later, (August) he messages me. I tell him I dont wanna talk to him and he says that he was really going through something and it had nothing to do with another girl. That night, he calls me. During this phone call, he got REALLY deep about his family, why he didn't wanna talk etc. This was also the first time we ever talked about relationships or anything with each other as we never did b4. He kept me on the phone for 7 hours to discuss what we're both looking for in a relationship, if I want kids or not, whats our darkest secrets etc. He also then wanted to be exclusive fwb to which I agreed. Then there was the real question he asked me which was \"would you ever date someone like me who is a working man as you would call it\" to which I said no. We were arguing like half the time of this phone call about relationships. Thinking back on this it makes me wonder if he was sending me a hint then and trying to see where I was at, but I turned him down without realizing.\n\nFast forward we took a break after that which lasted from August up until now (4 months). I messaged him around Thanksgiving, he told me had a girl doing long distance, I wished him the best. He adds me on a burner new snapchat 3 weeks later and tells me him and his gf are doing long distance until January and that she says it's okay to hookup with someone since their long distance. I told him I don't wanna fuck no ones man, but I agree to hookup with him once more and really end it. Well we did, and its over. He told me if anything doesn't work out, that he has my number and wishes me the best.\n\nThe funniest thing about this is that I asked him recently since were \"breaking up\" if he ever liked me in that way at all, to which he said no. Ik ik he said no, but im 90% convinced he is lying (not that it matters). I do think he did to some degree at one point, especially when we had that one phone call. Also, he told me I am the only person he slept with this year up until his gf he got.\n\nWhat do you all think since its over? I know I will get over it, but damn does it hurt to not have convenient dick when I come into town once a month lol. Also, u all think he was lying about the liking at one point?"

The breaking point was when it was late at night and I was hungry, and we finally found somewhere to get food, but he refused to go into the building because he saw his ex's sister in there. So we went home and I was still hungry. I got mad at him and we broke up the next day.\n\n6 months later, he wants to get back together. He told me he's sorry about what happened before, and he'll be better this time. It was tense at first because we never worked through our problems from the last time we were together. When we did talk through them, I asked if it won't happen again and he couldn't tell me yes. I got upset because we'd been talking again for a month and he was assuring me things will be better, but now he's saying he's not over the breakup with his ex's family. I told him I wouldn't be with him if he can't guarantee me it won't happen again, where he would cancel our plans together just because he saw her family member in a building. I don't think he should have stronger feelings towards his ex's family than his current gf. I told him it was really disrespectful to me, and asked why he would waste my time the past month getting me to re-process feelings when he didn't even change.\n\nHe said he panicked when he saw the sister, because he was still traumatized from the breakup and her family was like family to him so it was hard to lose them. He had problems with his own family (absent mother, broken family) so I think he attached to his ex's family as his own family. He says he is hurt by losing his ex's family but does not miss his ex.\n\nI wasn't sympathetic towards him still being attached to his ex's family, because I was still hurt and I blamed him. And my own parents were abusive, so I don't have a loving welcoming family to help him feel better or anything. My ultimatum and lack of understanding pushed him away and now he's not talking to me. He says he really likes me but he's really messed up and he doesn't think he's right for me. He asked me a couple times why I even like him. He knows I was really hurt by him ending things again last night, and asked me not to hate him. I texted him today and he didn't respond."

We've even together for about 4 months and I know that's not alot of time but I really do love her.

Its the typical situation where he's quite clearly in love with her while she insists he isn't. I'm never invited to these days out, he's apparently always making her feel uncomfortable and being creepy towards her. I think it's important that they're friends because they share some common interests that I cannot share with her so I'm glad she has someone to talk to about this stuff. But today we had our first argument as she told me that her mum has invited her ex to a Christmas lights event but not invited me. Of course this broke my heart into pieces as i was already hurt by the amount of time they were spending alone together. I told her that it's crossing a clear boundary but she won't stop insisting that it isn't like that. She's now gone to bed and I just can't sleep thinking about it.

Because I also don‚Äôt want any connections in my life, friendship or otherwise, with people that feel lukewarm towards me and treat me like an afterthought.\n\nThere‚Äôs also the issue of him having been my instructor, and even though the fall term is over (which should make this a non-issue), there‚Äôs the question of optics. He‚Äôs a first year graduate student from out of state, and reputation is very important in academia; even though pursuing a friendship or relationship with a former student may technically be above board, it may not look wonderful.\n\nSo I‚Äôm torn between giving him extra time to reach out, due to the nature of the situation and the fact that he may just genuinely be busy (also doesn‚Äôt know me very well yet so it makes a bit of sense that this isn‚Äôt #1 on his to-do list), or disqualifying him after a certain period of time passes without contact.\n\nI‚Äôd love some feedback on this one, so please feel free to chime in!\n\n**TL;DR - gave my (now former) TA my number at the end of the semester, how long should I wait for him to reach out?**"

As I think it's healthy to excersise from time to time and didn't see the harm in it as long as she didn't exagerate.anyways, that's the background. That brings us to now, 2 years and a half into our relationship.Recently, probably due to a number of stressfactors that are partially out of our control, she's stopped excersising and started comfort-eating more and started  gaining some more weight; not massive amounts, I can barely  tell( if at all) when I see her clothed.\n\nBut I can when she sends me explicit pictures, and sometimes when we're intimate. at first I didn't consiously register it but I notice and feel less sexually attracted to her body (she has always had the prettiest face and nothing's gonna change that). And it's not all the time or  every picture, certain poses or positions are just not as appealing anymore. This is not a massive isue for me but I fear it will put a strain on our relationship;Because she expects me to react excited to those pictures and while I can try to fake some excitement, I think she'll notice it's not as excited. And it also just doesn't feel right to lie to her like that.\n\nOn the other hand, I also don't want to tell her the truth (that sometimes, I'm less interested in her body because of her increase in weight, and that I would probably find her more sexually appealing if she lost some) because I know that that would destroy her.\n\nI realy don't know what to do about it and just kind of hoping that she either ends up losing some of the weight or that my brain learns to find her attractive like this too.\n\nPS: I want to stress that I do not blame her for gaining weight, as we're both going through a tough period in life and I've not maintained the best habits for myself either.PS2: she's not Obese or anything like that, I think that even now she's probably still healthy if maybe a little bit overweight. But Im not a doctor and I don't know her exact weight so don't take my word for it.PS3: she is already very self-consious about the weight she has recently gained, making it feel all the more important that I make her feel loved."

The house just got done being built and re toured it. I come over there once a week but only stay down stairs to chat with her and the husband. The husband didn‚Äôt say it directly but he basically said I‚Äôm able to stay the night if I want and said it in front of his wife, she didn‚Äôt care. He‚Äôs in his 70s, she‚Äôs is in her mid 50s and I‚Äôm 30yrs younger in mid 20s. They have 3 guest room . We were in her bedroom and i asked if the room across was the guest room, he said yes it is then I asked about the 2 rooms downstairs. He said ‚Äútechnically‚Äù there guest rooms and one of the downstairs ones has a small bathroom. The main guest room has no shower‚Ä¶. this would be the one I‚Äôd stay at, the only shower is in her bedroom‚Ä¶. Which is 10 steps away from the guest room. This couple aren‚Äôt intimate with each other and sleep in separate rooms. His room is downstairs. So if she has shown signs to me in the past, I‚Äôm able to stay the night, I‚Äôll be very close to her room, I‚Äôll be in the guest room and he‚Äôs farther away than me and the only bathroom upstairs is hers‚Ä¶.. like there‚Äôs no way right?  I feel like the husband is in on this. As if he wants me to do something with his wife. Why not tell me I‚Äôd be downstairs where the guest room that has an actual shower? Like is he wanting me to use her shower whiles she‚Äôs in the room? Or wanting me to do something since I‚Äôll be so close to her? Anything can happen at that point"

I'll try to explain that I'm just more tired than usual, I don't have a lot of energy, or my patience is thin for reasons that have nothing to do with them, but they either act the victim over it or interrogate me about what could be causing it. If I say it's just depression they get mad like im not doing everything in my power to try to keep the depression at bay.\n\nIt kind of has me feeling like I can't do anything right. I'm working my ass off to be as normal and happy as possible, but it seems like nothing is enough, and every micro expression I make is analyzed and scrutinized in a big way.

They did not take it well. My parents accused us of finacualky controlling them, my father called her controlling, my brother and sister-in-law(pregnant) both told my that night \"good luck with your wedding and marriage.\" And my sister-in-law as long told us that she feels she is getting emotional whiplash from us a d feels that her unborn child is going to be walked all over by us, so she wanted space.

Mostly speaking to my brother and his pregnant wife. My cousins haven't spoken to me almost at all the entire day, and I now feel that my family doesn't want me apart of them anymore.

She is very sweet, funny, and genuine, however there is one thing that concerns me and I'm uncertain if I am overthinking it, but she has both displayed and expressed a lack of ambition and any real life goals. \n\nShe is not completely lazy or anything, she works full time and went to school for two years to work as a medical assistant, which she loves doing, and I admire that. However, she has no plans for additional school, career advancement, networking, future children if we were to marry, among other things. She does not really do much outside of work. She consumes an astronomical amount of content from twitter, youtube, Netflix, etc, and this is what she described to me is her hobby. Her \"going out for the day\" is spending 15 minutes having me drive her to up Starbucks and returning home to do her \"hobby\". I can manage to get us to go on a hike every once in awhile, but it's been difficult to find things to do recently when her interests are limited. \n\nI think I am a fairly ambitious individual. I'm working towards a computer engineering degree at my university, currently work a well paying job in IT while also trying to get a higher paying job in software development, and develop my skills everyday on my own. I spend a lot of time learning, making new projects, going to the gym, socializing with friends and acquaintances, doing schoolwork, working, and have an overall drive and hunger to succeed at my goals. I have big dreams, but we do not seem to see eye to eye in the context of ambition. \n\nWe have sat down and talked about this 1on1, and that is when she told me what her \"hobby\" was and that I should accept it. She told me she doesn't really have any current ambitions, and brought up that traveling might be a goal of hers, but aside from the short and close trips we've taken I've never really seen her exhibit any true interest in this. I do allocate a lot of time to her, and try to make her a priority, but she thinks the things I do get in the way of that time.\n\nI do care about her, but I'd like some feedback on if this is something that can work out or if it's the start of an incompatible relationship. I do not desire to convince her or to change her in any way, she is fine how she is, but due to our difference in lifestyles I'm having a hard time seeing how we can be happy together in the long run despite being happy now."

                "body": "\nHello all,\n\nI'm seeking advice on my relationship between myself (26M) and my recent ex (25f). We started dating in early February of 2022 and the first few months were amazing. We met on bumble and she comes off as rather flat and uninterested through text, her profile had literally no information and all her pictures looked like they were really glammed up which made me think I might be getting catfished. Nonetheless, I was absolutley blown away by her beauty and really wanted to speak with her so after 2 days of a steady texting conversation I wanted to set up a date with her since I figured she didn't seem super interested in the conversation (which I found out was not true at all, she just doesn't communicate well over text). I was still worried about being catfished so the day before the date I asked her to video call. We talked for four hours and she seemed very upbeat and was amazing to talk to and share stories of both of our different cultures. \n\nWe met for our date the next day and had an amazing time and ended up talking for another four hours untill she had to go and pick up her dog from the daycare. We ended up talking on average 2 to 6 hours per day over video call for the next week and really felt like we knew almost everything there is to know about eachother just through speaking. Obviously there is a lot to learn about a person as you are with them, but the things that could be expressed verbally were amazing. She really inspired me as a person who was able to overcome any challenge that life threw at her, raising a dog all on her own, moving to her dream city to pursue her dreams. She is truly an inspirational person in my life.\n\nShe lives in another city about an hour and a half to two hour drive away, so one of the exciting things was exploring eachothers cities. We end up going on two dates before I look her in the eyes and ask her to be my girlfriend she said yes and we had an amazing relationship. We both really enjoyed talking to eachother and expressing ourselves. She grew up in a home where her father was rather abusive and had all three of her exes be somewhat abusive as well. She described what we had as a breath of fresh air and was really happy that she felt like she could he herself around me. We genuinely talked about a future and I felt so warm and welcomed by her family and friends and we were so excited to build a future together. \n\nOver the next few months we spend a lot of time together, mostly me staying at her house for a few days to a week at a time (she rented her own apartment alone) and I work online so I was able to get any work I needed to done during the day when she was gone at work. I would help to clean the house as well in my spare time there.\n\nI was genuinely happy at this time, however when wanting her to watch one of my favorite movies, she just didn't seem like she respected this thing that I enjoyed and always sort of acted like it would be a chore. We watched the movie but she sat on her phone the whole time and in the middle of it got up to do her dishes and vacuum the apartment. I felt terrible like I was being really disrespected, but didn't really say anything and it didn't seem like she was listening. Her and I both have the tendency to not open up about things unless they grow and become much bigger problems than they are and that was one of them and it always sort of bothered me after that. \n\nShe would often make jokes about her \"other boyfriend\" to tease me. These jokes really bothered me because I didn't feel like we were secure enough at that point in our relationship to joke about those things. There was one point where she said \"you're just the intermediate. I'm with you to pass the time till the next one comes along\" and I was so angry. I didn't yell at her but I straight up told her once I cooled down that it really hurt me. She still would make the jokes but never that harsh and as we grew in our relationship I felt secure enough at times to joke along too. \n\nFast forward to June, she ends up getting a promotion at her job that ends up putting a lot of stress on her. Meanwhile I start Grad school and focusing on my language studies (was wanting to go for a certificate in a foreign language with the idea of maybe moving to another country someday). This took a lot of energy that I had to devote to our relationship and as time went on we talked over the phone less and less, almost never video calling and resorted to texting all the time (where we don't really communicate well). She complained angrily once that she felt like I was taking over her space, so we end up talking it out and I decide to keep my stuff neatly stored away and respect her home and her space more and to not spend so much time just hanging out at her house so she felt like she could have a balanced amount of alone time. I'm still heavy into my studies. This is a habit that I only recently broke where I hyperfixate on things and only with our breakup did it make me realize that I need to be more mindful of that and make those changes because it affects all of my relationships and my ability to enjoy life. \n\n\n Fast forward to August she talks to me and tells me shes been really stressed latley over a lot of things but also that before she saw our future clearly but the last few weeks it was really blurry. I told her that I love her with all my heart and if she wants me to let her go I will let her go. She said no because there was still something there.\n\n We went on a vacation the next day to go and see some of her college friends and visit her college town and had an amazing time. We sat down and talked briefly and she said she felt like herself again and that things were okay. I was preparing for a trip to another country that I was studying the language for and completley devoted myself to it and even worse when I came back, barely talking to her outside of basic texts for the next few months and the occasional phone call. I would still go visit her every few weeks, but was never able to be decisive  when making decisions about things to do and whenever she suggested maybe going downtown i would just say \"well theres probably traffic\". When I was overseas for those two weeks I would get a lot of messages saying she missed me and wished i lived closer to her (the only time distance ever seemed like an issue, otherwise she always made it clear that it wasn't). \n\nI was also sick with COVID while abroad and sick a lot over the course of the last 2 months (October and november). These months I really felt like her behavior toward me became more neglectful. I have had issues before with mild panic attacks going to clubs and convert halls due to some past issues and one of her favorite things to do is to go out clubbing and dancing for fun. Her cousins invited us and in the few hours before I sort of got really quiet and she really impressed me by sitting me down and looking me in the eyes and talking me through it. I felt like we had communicated better than we ever had before. We went and had an insane time and I found out that I really love clubbing and dancing and letting loose. \nThe next day is Thanksgiving. I'm a little tired from the night before because we woke up early the next day to get ready. We drive to her aunts house  with me in the passenger seat. I have a tendency to get vertigo when in the car and I had it BAD and it wouldn't go away the whole evening. We were there maybe 3 hours before she asked if I wanted to go home and we did. She didn't speak a single word to me and was clearly angry with me. She didn't ask how I was feeling or if I was okay and the next morning when I tried to hug her before she left for work she pushed me away. I had a feeling in my stomach that we might be breaking up soon because I didn't feel like I was being treated right. So rather than try to talk, my mind went straight to just breaking up.\n\nA few days later I'm back at home and I'm still angry over how she treated me. I pick up the phone to call her and she tells me she wants a kid before 30 and a house during our conversation. That she wishes I supported her dream of the house more and that I was more decicive and that what I viewed as healthy communication talking to me over the clubbing fears was her practically begging me. We get into a mild argument and she says we can try to work things out and see where we are by January. The way she described herself feeling was exactly how I felt with my ex. I was emotional and immediately said no and we broke up. I called her later asking if she would change her mind and she said no. I immediately reacted and deleted all pictures we had together off social media and removed the \"in a relationship\" off my Facebook. Which I I hurt her a lot. \n\nI went to her house next day to exchange our belongings and trying to maintain composure but I started crying. I told her my goals had changed and that what I really want in life is that nice little house and to share my life with her. She has always had a problem feeling like a burden  and that she hates to see me hurting this way. We said our goodbyes and I left her house for the last time and said goodbye to her dog. The next few days were hell. I generally left her alone and took the advice of my friends not to text her other than to organize another meeting. She said it would be our last one. We organized it for Monday the 5th. I just wanted closure. After speaking with my therapist, i ended up canceling the meeting and telling her we should both just take some time apart and think about things before meeting again. \n\nI called her a few days later to talk to her and ask her to reconsider. She responded saying that she was thinking about moving back to her college town where her friends are because she realized it was okay to not always challenge herself and to be where she's comfortable. I was basically her only support system in the city she always dreamed to live in. So I tell her everything I talked about with my therapist, that I feel like our relationship went the way it did because we didn't communicate the way we should have, that I have changed by goals because running away to another country was definitley not healthy for me at the time, that I am putting the people that I love in my life in first place rather than materialism or goals that just help me avoid life's responsibilities, and that I will be more decicive and a better communicator. She almost said yes, but said that it was too soon and that maybe we just didn't meet eachother at the right time. So we decided that we will stay in eachothers lives and be friends and not talk for a while.\n\nI have worked hard over the last few weeks on my relationships with others, to overcome my fear of certain things and indecisiveness and to realize there really are plenty of other fish in the sea. I am ready to accept that I may never be with her again and am losing the fear of that every day, but I still realize that because she is such an amazing person that I really want to build something new  with  her and want to contact her again after the holidays are over and see if she wants to meet up. \n\nThis whole fiasco is a result of a failure of both of us, but especially me to listen and be there when needed. I know I will never make that same mistake with her again. Reddit, what can I do?"

I am usually the one to initiate, which is fine, but it has been like that for awhile now. so I asked her if everything was good and she said yea of course. this went on for awhile with me initiating going out....and her hanging out/going out with other friends beside me, which is fine because we all have our own friend groups....but i asked again and she basically said that she doesn't always want to hangout because the guys tend to talk to me....I'm not really sure how to react to this because I have a boyfriend and I'm not seeking out a guy in any way...I want to go out because I want to spend time with my friend...She's single and says she's happy too so I don't see the problem here.\n\nI can see how it might be frustrating because there was this one guy and we were all talking and it was casual, not flirty. Then he goes \"so how long have you guys been single\" (which I thought was kinda a weird question tbh but whatever) and I responded oh I'm actually seeing someone.

She was nice to me and even said things to my boyfriend like ‚Äúyou better not break up with her (me) cuz I like her.‚Äù So I was okay with his friendship with her but eventually I found out he used to like her romantically.

About 1 year later we decided to give it another go, 2 month in and everything was fine and after that we started arguing every day. For example the other day she texted me saying that she is gonna go out drinking with her friends and then go to her male friends house 1 on 1 to smoke weed, I replied by saying i‚Äôm cool with her going out but don‚Äôt feel comfortable with her going to his place to smoke as i don‚Äôt know the guy and i don‚Äôt know his intentions (she also mentioned couple times that he makes inappropriate jokes which i wasn‚Äôt too happy about but didn‚Äôt say anything). Now after I said that she started getting annoyed as to why i don‚Äôt want her to go to his house and stuff and ended up with her just going out for drinks. The next day when she came over i sat down with her to talk about it, i explained to her that i overthink a lot and that i been in situations where i been cheated on and stuff, and again she starts saying stuff like ‚Äúso now your saying that i will go and f#%* him‚Äù, ‚Äúis this gonna be a issue every time i go out with my friends‚Äù which made me feel somewhat guilty, anyway she just kept blaming it on me in a way, someone let me know if i did something wrong.\n\nWe had another argument, so normally we see each other Friday to Sunday, she stays over as during the week we both got work. She went out with her friends on Saturday evening and said she will be home about 10pm so i said i will wait for her, i won‚Äôt lie i was a bit upset as i didn‚Äôt get to spend time with her on Friday and also Saturday now as she went out, but I didn‚Äôt say nothing. Around 9pm i get a call from her asking if am allright with her going to the club as all her friends are now going there, and because i was a bit upset and because of the previous argument i just said ‚Äúi would like for you to come home but you do what you want as my answer won‚Äôt matter‚Äù she seemed kinda fine with it. Now she got home, again i got the blame for it and she started saying that i‚Äôm being controlling and apparently i said ‚Äúno‚Äù.\n\n\nNow again today another argument over a petty thing, so apparently she put something on my brothers desk and he came to give it to her, she got annoyed as he wasn‚Äôt exactly nice about it but she know that‚Äôs basically his and he can use it when he want if that makes sense, she got annoyed about it and started kinda talking back which i didn‚Äôt like as he was right so i just told both of them to leave it, she said something along the lines ‚Äúwhy you always on his side‚Äù in a way i did not like but i just said ‚Äúyou two need to stop arguing‚Äù and then she tells me off because i was talking to her as she would say ‚Äúlike shit‚Äù, now i know some times she doesn‚Äôt realise that she might be rude towards me but this day she been talking with a tone most of the times and i just ignored it. Now after she said that i was talking to her like shit, i just said ‚Äúyou been talking to me like that the hole time u been here‚Äù and i just left the room as i didn‚Äôt want an argument, but we haven‚Äôt spoken yet as she most likely is expecting me to come back and say sorry.\n\nCan someone please give me some advice as i don‚Äôt want the relationship to end the same way it did the first time."

It wasn't until I graduated high school that I started to hang out with him like allot, we became really close like extremely close. He has always been a nice person and everything he said or did was real cute, he would not act 24 lol. He started to call me \"bff,\" he always wanted to be with me and he was always trying to hug me and hold my hand, he would tell me that he loved me and would get mad if I hanged out with other people. I felt a little weird when he would do all those things because I was straight and he was too, with him always being so nice to everyone though I didn't think much of it. He didn't care who we were around with, he would call me bff, he would tell me that he loved me and all this other stuff. About 2 years go by and we're still best friends but he had a gf and he got her pregnant, I would get so mad that they were together but I never told him anything because he can be with whoever he wants to be, he didnt know that I had fallen in love with him and I didnt want him to find out. He ended up moving for about a month with his gf to another city about 4 hours away. We always talked and he would always tell me that he loved me more than anything and that he missed me and wanted to see me and all kinds of cute stuff. One day I guess they broke up and he called me and asked me if I can please pick him up and his stuff because he had broken up with his gf. I didnt have a car at that time so my sister and I asked our mom if we could use her car to go hang out with some friends for a bit and she agreed. We ended up picking up my best friend and we made it back home and he asked me if he can live with me for some time and I said yes, that he could stay as long as he wants. All my family knows him and they like him, my mom didnt mind. He lived with me for about 5 months and during those 5 months, I was the happiest person in the entire world. I was with him 24/7 and we were both real happy living together and sharing the same room. We were best friends but we were the gayest \"straight\" best friends to ever live lol. He would always tell me that he loved me and he got mad if I didnt say it back, I would tell him that I loved him too and he would tell me that he loved me more and he would hug me and we would sleep together in the same bed, sometimes naked and we would do all kinds of stuff together. Everything a couple would do but we werent a couple, he was my best friend and I was his. It was pretty hard not to fall in love with someone like him especially after everything he would tell me, how he acted with me, how he treated me. We both looked so happy and my family would ask us if we were gay or if we were dating because of how we were with each other and we would say no, that we werent gay. Anyways, one night we went to a night club and we had a great time, we were drunk and made it back home around 3 am. I remember he took of my shoes and pants and he did the same, we were both in boxers and we got into bed and I remember falling asleep on his chest and he was kinda like hugging me. When I woke up that morning, he was not there anymore. He had left when I was asleep and he took all his clothes and stuff with him. I didnt think much of it but then I decided to message him on Facebook and I asked him where he was. He left me on seen and then blocked me. He never told me why, he just got up and left and forgot about me like if I never meant anything to him. I tried to look for him over and over and over but he didnt answer my messages or texts or calls or anything. I didnt understand why he had left, he left me with so many questions that to this day, i still dont know the answer to. It has always taken me so much to cry for something but when he did this to me I cried almost every day for 6 months straight. I didnt want to know anything about anyone, I wanted to just be by myself, I was extremely depressed and still am but not so much. I don't understand how he could do this to me after everything. I want to just die sometimes, the pain of getting your heart broken is something else, never have I felt so sad in my life, nothing has ever hurt me like this before and I just want this feeling to go away. Ive come to realize that I have to move on and forget about him but I dont know how. Does anyone have any advice on how they got over someone that meant everything to them? I don't know what to even do anymore."

After that i felt just broken, i said okay love i love you , and she replies back i love you too. After that i just constantly overthink that this is end, that she is not coming back‚Ä¶ But everything was fine until wednesday üò≠‚Ä¶ After that i text her like‚Äù if you tihink thats best for me, you, us. I will give you space.‚Äù and she said ‚Äú yes i think thats the best.‚Äù And that happend in friday 16.12.2022. She didnt go out that day when that happend.

Everything goes down after she got bad grade when she tried to fix it because of stupid professor, 8th december we planned the new year eve and everything was fine until wednesday when she got that bad grade, she starts ignoring me, small replies etc. After I asked her whats wrong she told me that she is overloaded with everything and that she needs a space. That‚Äôs what she wanted,she said that she loves me at the end.  i didnt text her for 2 days now, but she was on birthday with friends and when i see her its like that she isnt even bothered because we are on break.

She said ‚Äúi would‚Äôve just told you if i was by now‚Äù I think he had a crush on her or she does on him . He has said some rude things to me and i‚Äôve asked her to stop talking to him and she said no. \n\nAnyways continuing on for part 3:\nThey say they have never called before and never hung out besides the bus and during school. Ever since he came she started acting different and she claims it was because of the first breakup. People are telling me to break up with her but everytime we do something pulls me back in. I think it‚Äôs the memories that I don‚Äôt want to let go of. Anyways on snapchat i noticed their snap streak is higher than her and mine is. (theirs is 52 while mine and hers is 50) and you may be thinking ‚Äúso what?‚Äùi asked her if she cared abt her snap streak and she said no. i asked her to ruin their snap streak and said ‚Äúi don‚Äôt want to‚Äù and i said ‚Äúbut you don‚Äôt care?‚Äù and i do care and she seemed to ignore it. Yk how they have those friendship things on snap. Theirs is the one where they have been  each others for 2+ weeks. and ours is just ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù i‚Äôm tired of it and i‚Äôm so close to breaking up with her but i love her too much. i cry everyday bc of her"

Over time I somehow grew attached to her and I consider her a friend.\n\nBut I am not sure if I should try to ask her out eventually.\nThe thing is, she wants to become a doctor and study in a well-known university. I want to do a work and travel in scandinavia before studying in a special school of my field.\n\nThere will be quite the distance between us. For a friendship this is fine. I have contact to a few friends long distance. But I don't know how that would effect a relationship. And it kinda scares me.\n\nIn a way I don't think it would be fair to her if I told her how I feel, even if feelings should be mutual (which my anxiety doubts lol). Because I wouldn't be there for almost a year after we graduate.\nAnd if the feelings are not reciprocated I am scared to lose our friendship. I am fine just being friends honestly.\n\nOn the other hand maybe I should at least talk to her about this once we know each other for longer, so she can decide too. I'm not really sure how she feels about me.\nSome time ago she asked me to sit next to her in one of our classes. First it was nothing more. We never really touched, but gradually closed this space between us. Now I can't even concentrate in class because she pokes me every time, or draws protection symbols on me, or steals my hand to warm up hers lol\n\nI'm not one for human interactions. My emotional intelligence is lower and it's hard for me to tell what others feel or think. There are just some signs that indicate for me that we at least aren't strangers anymore but it could really just be that she sees me as a friend.\nI'm really just dull in that regards\n\nI don't really see a crush as love btw. Love is something that grows over time and can develope in different ways. So I would be happy to just be friends and the crush will fade. This I'm sure of. I know myself well enough.\n\nBut what haunts me is the question if I should open up to her or keep it to myself, because I don't know what would be best for her. I don't want to put her in a tough spot by accident.\n\nAny advice or storys of those in similar circumstances are appreciate\n\nTLDR: Unsure if I should communicate my feelings to my crush because of the different paths we will take after school, or if I should just keep it to myself and stay friends"

I had bought tickets to a bluegrass concert at this small pub because I knew she liked bluegrass.\n\nShe ended up standing me up and not showing up, so I went alone. It was there I met this woman in her 50s/60s who I noticed was also alone. I thought to myself... what the heck I might as well have a good time.\n\nI approached her and said \"hey\" and asked if I could buy her a drink. We still had the opening act, so we had an hour to kill. I bought her a drink. I found out she was a music teacher at a college, and we had one of the best convos of my life.\n\nWe then rolled down a blanket and sat on the ground, and watched the rest of the show. We have an awesome time!\n\nAt the end of the show she goes \"I'm so glad I decided to go tonight. I had a really fun time.\" She tells me about this other bar, and when she's going to be there and gave me a hug. Exchanged contacts.\n\nI really don't regret it. Despite our age difference, we were two single people that had a great time. I knew it wasn't going to turn into anything, but it was good dating practice. Way better than going home and feeling sorry for myself for the rest of the night."

                "body": "\nThis past June, my (26F) ex (25M) contacted me after almost two years of being apart. We dated on and off for about 5 years and have known each other since high school. He since started a relationship with someone else. He told me he missed me for a long time, and wanted to know if I‚Äôd be willing to talk to him. I was curious. I thought of him as the love of my life and I missed him too. He told me he wanted to break up with his girlfriend. (Long story short, that didn‚Äôt end up happening.) He said he was unhappy with her, that he felt like he was losing himself and slowly being stripped away by being with her. His dilemma was that they live together and recently signed a new lease and didn‚Äôt want to lose a bunch of money by breaking it. He told me they were basically just roommates now and didn‚Äôt have much of a physical relationship. He told me all the things he missed about being with me, that I was the best thing in his life. We met a couple weeks after he initially contacted me and it was like no time had passed. Our connection and the spark we had was still there. We ended up having sex. I know it was wrong, but at the time I honestly felt like he would leave his girlfriend and we would end up together. Over the next several months, we kept in contact. We stayed up late talking, flirting, etc. Right before my birthday, in August, we talked about our feelings for each other. He told me that the way I made him feel was special and how grateful he was to have experienced it at all. That I was important to him. I told him I felt the same way, and that our connection was something I‚Äôd never experienced with anyone else and how much I missed it when we were apart. He wished me a happy birthday and then after that, communication instantly fell short. We didn‚Äôt talk for all of September. I figured maybe he needed space and wanted to give that to him. He called me late one night in October and we had phone sex. We met up for drinks a few days later. He told me that things with his girlfriend had gotten a little better, but he yet he still contacted me. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to say. At this point, it seemed clear to me that he was just using me to fill a hole in his relationship, which I wanted no part of. I knew I wanted all or nothing with him and didn‚Äôt want to be a part of an ongoing affair. Thanksgiving weekend, he reached out again and we chatted for a bit, and then he tried to turn to the conversation over to sexting. I called him out on it, and told him I didn‚Äôt appreciate him using me like that and that I wanted to feel respected. He apologized right away, but that was the last time we spoke. Yesterday I noticed that he deleted me on Snapchat. I texted him today and asked him why and he read my message, didn‚Äôt respond and then just blocked my number. I‚Äôm honestly so confused and hurt. I hate to think that he just used me and is now discarding me. Especially after all we‚Äôve been through and the amount of times he‚Äôs told me how much he cares for me. I just feel stupid. I also still feel horrible about his girlfriend, to my knowledge she has no idea about what happened between us. I think she has the right to know but I don‚Äôt think it would be good coming from me. Please keep the mean comments to a minimum. I know my part in this was wrong, but I honestly cared and loved him so much that I think I didn‚Äôt see the situation clearly. I guess‚Ä¶ what do I do now?"

                "body": "First off I‚Äôm new to this Reddit thing but I‚Äôm looking for non bias advice. I(27f) have been in a relationship with my bf(27m) for around 6 years. We had a really rough start but I can honestly say I have never loved another significant other the way I love him. But I also have never been hurt by anyone the way he has hurt me. \n\nImma start off with the past. Because all though he‚Äôs changed a lot it‚Äôs something that has really affected me. And maybe I shouldn‚Äôt mention it since it‚Äôs not relevant to our recent fight but it‚Äôs something that I have to deal with because he has changed he‚Äôs no longer that person or so I hope but I can‚Äôt help but wonder how I could forgive all this and he can‚Äôt take the fact that I‚Äôm messy. \n\n1. He choose his ex over me and spent the night at her house while still texting me. It killed me. On time I remember I was on my way over he called me as I was on my way to cancel our plans which I was very excited for said he had to do something with his parents turns out he was talking with his ex. He even had me pick him up one at night when his car broke down at her house and my dumbass still drove for a long way to get him. \n\n2. I caught him multiple times texting some girl. I told him to stop but he said they were just friends but she kept asking him to see her at work then I saw her send some inappropriate pictures. \n\n3 same thing happens caught him texting another girl he said it was his cousin turns out she wasn‚Äôt. Turns out they had made out and stuff again heart broken we broke up and ‚Ä¶\n\n4. He had a whole other relationship with another girl he tried to make it work with her but still kept leading me on and it finally took us the other girl and me to talk and figure out he was playing us both. He told me he wanted me and he wasn‚Äôt going to talk to her anymore. But he still did until eventually his birthday where I went to drop off a card and balloons at his house but he wasn‚Äôt responding at this point I knew where she lived and I saw them in his car broke my heart again but I still forgave him\n\nThere were other but these were the ones that really got to me and now writing them down really goes to show how much hurt and pain but I learned to forgive it took me a lot and I got over it so I thought.\n\nI also wanted to point out that I have never cheated on him. \n\nWe eventually needed up moving in together. Things were great for a while he put in the effort and showing me more affection which is something that we had issues with before and the cheating stopped. Things were great. But he didn‚Äôt have the greatest childhood he suffered and because of that he has some issues. \n\nHe‚Äôs very easy to change up he gets fits of rage and he just changes. His anger issues where really starting to affect me. I always feel like I‚Äôm just not good enough. He will throw things slam doors even though a cup of water at my face he says he wasn‚Äôt aiming at me but I still was splashed with water. His anger has lead to physical things before in the past something I‚Äôve never told anyone. And there‚Äôs a lot that I‚Äôm just not willing to share but yeah it‚Äôs been rough. But I know he knows if he were to ever lay hands on me again I would walk out for good no questions asked. \n\nI recently left the house to go back to my parents because we had one argument too many and I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. Things are tight my parents house is small and I also took out dog I sleep on the couch but my parents always make me feel welcomed. \n\nI‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm not the best gf ever. I don‚Äôt know how to cook and in fact it gives me mad anxiety. I‚Äôm very emotional. I‚Äôm also very forgetful and messy. I also smoke pot and I‚Äôm currently at my lowest. I lost my hr job I have a college degree but I‚Äôm working at wear house. I‚Äôve been dealing with some health issues as well.\n\nI don‚Äôt ask for much we have always split financial stuff 50/50 including groceries rent house hold items and things for our dog. And I feel bad leaving him to pay the full rent. \n\nThe last couple times we fought has been due to my messiness. He gets mad cause I forget to pick up my clothes from the restroom or I don‚Äôt close a cabinet door. Or I left weed outside on top the washer machine. He also got mad that I chose to get ready before that house is clean even though he was sleeping while I was getting ready. He has told me before that it bugs him because he grew up with his mom always giving crap for doing stuff like that. And I tried to be more organized but I guess it‚Äôs not something that comes natural to me and sometimes I do forget and I‚Äôm willing to admit it‚Äôs true I am messy and I have been trying to change it‚Äôs just hard for me. \n\nSo I feel hypocritical because I‚Äôm also asking him to change the way he reacts and talks to me  which I know is also hard\n\nNow I have been gone for a couple weeks and we have been trying to work on things cause I still do love him so much but his depression and anger issues have really taken a toll on me.  And I saw he had added a girl on Facebook who he had a relationship with before. I had previously told him to block her but he said he added her when we were still together not when I left. Which I still find really disrespectful I told him I was hurt and he blocked her. I know he hasn‚Äôt cheated and he‚Äôs not trying to talk to anyone else he says he wants me but even though we had rebuilt trust it‚Äôs started to feel hard to trust again especially cause I‚Äôm not living with him. \n\nWe have been trying to make it work but I still feel this tension and anxiety around him. I love him and I don‚Äôt want to let him go especially because I know he‚Äôs been through alot and I feel for him I grew up in a very loving family and he didn‚Äôt I wanted to show him that love and even though my parents have seen me suffer through this relationship they have constantly welcomed him with open arms because they wan me to be happy. I just don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre just too different but I found me asking myself if I really wanted to be in the relationship multiple times . I know I love him I have no doubt I wouldn‚Äôt have forgave him for everything in the past if I didn‚Äôt and when we hang out I do love spending time with him he makes me laugh and I can be myself around him he says he will change and I want things to work but idk what to do anymore. Do you think he will change his attitude. I want to be there for him because I know he‚Äôs depressed. I‚Äôve asked him to get help but I know he has no health insurance. I just don‚Äôt know what to do go back home try to make it work give it one last chance or walk away but I know that it will hurt both of us."

They moved to different states recently and we have kept in very close touch, taking turns visiting each other through out the years and so on. A few weeks ago we all had a trip together that just didn't really go well. They complained the entire time and we also got in several arguments over petty things. I also don't smoke anymore and that was one major thing we all used to bond over. I didn't make it an issue and even rolled their doobies so I could feel in some way I was participating.\n\nI am also treated for my anxiety now, which was something we all had in common before, so their anxious energy was just not vibing well with me. They even kind of slighted that my medicine wasn't \"good\" for me when they smoke weed every day as soon as they take their first breath in the morning to help with theirs. \n\nThey also proceeded to try and tell me that I need help because I \"drink so much\", just because I could drink a few glasses of whiskey and not be drunk like they were after a cocktail or two. \n\nIt's almost like they are making me feel ashamed of the person I have become. I have changed 100% for the better in my opinion, I'm happy, have a wonderful career and fiance, and yet they think he's changing me into this mean person. When in reality I just don't let people walk all over me like they used to and I stand up for myself when I need to.\n\nAlso these ladies are supposed to be my Bridesmaids for my wedding in October next year. I just am not sure what to do. I just want them to accept me. They clearly don't. Not only that, but they are talking about me behind my back and have said hurtful things, as another friend of mine told me. I may have said hurtful things to them, but at least I told them to their faces. I didn't think it was an issue and fully expected them to be honest back with me."

He's polite and sweet, and back then, always made sure to leave my favorite cookies on my desk (never told him they were, but he noticed me getting them from the vending machine), made a note to compliment  me in a very friendly and respectful manner, even introducing me to a few high shots of his own company as \"his dear friend\", or letting me know he had seen me walking to work one morning and thought of offering me a ride, but chickened out thinking he would be seen as a creep. I never really understood if he was flirting, or just being friendly to me, and besides I was taken and although he never met my BF, he never crossed any line.\n\nThen pandemic hit, and we went separate ways, but spoke every day, he was depressed and I tried to help, but eventually he met someone who helped him. And I let him go, we didn't speak in months.\n\nHe broke up with her shortly after, and came back to talk to me, always listening, always respectful, then got someone again, I kept dating my current BF, and after a few months Max came back and left again.\n\nFast forward, I called him this morning, I talked to him about my relationship, cried a bit, because heavens know I love my BF, I just can't stand being an ATM anymore, then, to cheer me up, he told me he had a surprise he had been saving for Christmas and forwarded me a license for a coding bootcamp, from a language I told him MONTHS ago I wanted to learn...my heart melted, I swear, all this time, he REMEMBERED...the bootcamp is cheap, but he listened, and remembered...he told me he thought I was just too busy for him (what?, no!), and so he stayed away, and implied he is single again\n\nNow, Reddit...am I misinterpreting?, is he just being friendly?, do I let him go again?, he has every right to leave and be happy if someone is ignoring him for too long, but if I'm misinterpreting...I AM leaving current BF, and certainly am not desperate for a man, but that little detail has touched me so deeply\n\nPlease help"

When i asked her why she said she felt no emotion got together with a poor girl just cause she was bored and liked the fact that girl was very very in love with her. Not exactly in those words but looking back that's the gist of it. \n\nAbout 2 months before that i got left by a guy i got really connected to and was very very hurt by it since it was my first relationship i thought of as serious. \n\nSo anyways i am still grieving, and even tho i liked Ivy ( fake current gf name) i personally wasn't ready for the relationship. I liked the close flirty friendship we had but i didn't want to commit to anything since i really wasn't ready. Of course i told her that. She however continued to tell me how much she liked me and how she is persistent and how she will not stop until she gets what she wants. Our friends kept telling us how we should get together cause we are \" so good for eachother\" and i gave in, well at first i jokingly called her my gf around her ex who is at our uni cause he keeps flirting with her. She kept making me tell her how i feel about her expecting me to say that i feel the same way she does ( she said multiple times how she is so in love with me) and even though so much time passed i don't think i can feel like that or at least not towards her. \n\nSo now that we have been officially together for about a month i am realising that its becoming really really hard to ignore all the red flags about her and how she still acts so childishly getting mad when i don't answer her message or when im too busy to hang out with her or when i simply do not want to share my problems with her cause i know she isn't gonna be very helpful. \n\nI realise i had gotten myself stuck since im dating a person within a friend group who is more influential on the judgment of the whole group as an older member i do not have any support and will probably lose most of my friends if we break up. I do realise that if friends leave me over something pitiful as a breakup they are not much of a friend group at all but im really comfortable with them and I really like them, they are basically my entire support system in uni and i don't want to lose that too.\n\nSo i honestly need some advice, should I try to bring it up and salvage this relationship or should I break up. I know that breakup will really really hurt her and I'm trying not to postpone it too much because it will only make things worse, but i really don't know what to do to make this as painless as possible, usually im the one who gets really attached and people leave me so i really don't want her to see me the way i see my exes since i do care about her a lot there are just a lot of things that are crossing my line about her and I feel like being alone would be better for me."

We have learned a lot about each other in this short time but I always find that the conversation is always surrounding my weight/body type and my sex life. The first thing he texted me after we greeted each other for the first time was ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a lot of luck on this app. I don‚Äôt know why. I respect women 100% and I‚Äôm not a creep or anything.‚Äù As a woman I know for a fact that if we was a genuine guy he would be in a relationship by now.

So I overlooked that statement and decided to continue having conversations with him. After all, I‚Äôve never been in a real relationship so I don‚Äôt know how this should work. What started as simple questions like ‚Äúso are you skinny, thick, or athletic?‚Äù Became ‚Äúdo you have small boobs or big boobs?‚Äù Or ‚Äúis your butt big?‚Äù And then eventually ‚Äúhow much do you weigh.‚Äù These questions wouldn‚Äôt annoy me so much if I didn‚Äôt have full body profile pictures. He can clearly see that I‚Äôm of small stature and size and he asks this anyway. It‚Äôs important for me to point out that I am a bisexual woman and I‚Äôm more interested in women. I told him this and he responded ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to watch you go at it with girls.‚Äù As if my attraction to women is just a tool for him to get turned on. He is always talking about sex and it makes me feel like an object. Like that‚Äôs the only way he can connect with a woman. It sucks to admit but if the girls I swiped right on matched with me I wouldn‚Äôt be talking to men at all. I don‚Äôt know if every guy behaves this way and this is how men normally express interest in women or if I‚Äôm dealing with an actual creep. \n\nWe‚Äôre supposed to go on a date tomorrow but I‚Äôm not really up for it.

We then started catching feelings and soon about 3 months ago we started dating. We really liked each other and hid it from her brother for a while. We had a really sweet relationship but nothing really intimate, just hand holdings and huggings and her brother was completely ok with it too. We never had a fight and always talked ourselves out of conflict. But recently her parents found out and forced her to break up with me and cut all communication with me. We mainly talked through discord so she made it clear on there that we cut clean. We then however now use a shared word document to communicate. We formally ended it but we both know we still have feelings for each other. She wants me to move on because she thinks it'll be the best for me but I stated that I really do love her. She didn't tell me that I should stop and just say that she wants me to be happy.\n\nBut we both are heartbroken, we talked about it on the document and we both agreed to support each other no matter what. I know this sounds awfully stupid to older adults but we really had a hard week or two on the breakup. I'm glad that both of us don't hate each other and we all agreed that we should be happy. This is however not known by her parents, they assumed that she cut me clean.\n\nWe are considered the \"smart kids\" or nerds in high school taking on multiple AP classes, and academic teams, and have 4.0s. Our relationship has not affected our grades and I would even argue that studying together has actually improved our grades. I don't understand why her parents wanted to cut me off, we have similar cultural backgrounds, the same religion, and both come from a conservative family. In school, we kinda were the \"model\" for dating where each side engage in a mutually beneficial relationship that practiced abstinence. What should we do and how should I deal with this? Are her parents the main fault? and if she follows her parents' order to break up with me, why does she give me hope in the future and continue to talk to me when she shouldn't?"

Once I opened up more and made it clear I was into him, he kinda backed off and also went out of town for a week and didn‚Äôt respond to a couple texts while he was away. He responded and apologized as soon as he got back but I think for me the damage had been done. I began to feel more insecure and uncomfortable around him, like I couldn‚Äôt really be myself. He then said he might be moving across the country but if we felt it was worth it we could keep seeing each other casually. I was willing to try it but then he basically started giving me ultimatums and saying I need to challenge him more for him to be serious about me.

She had done it, according to her, because she was in a lot of emotional anguish leaving her starved for support or attention (I was not physically with her during the month it happened). The \"conditions\" on which we got back together included her getting therapists to help her process some of the emotional pain she was in, which helped some of the co-dependent aspects of our relationship. There's a bit more to this, but I'm not a great writer and I don't really want to get into all of it again.\n\nNow: She has been talking to me about this work friend of hers who initially, she was positive about, but increasingly has been more and more negative on. She told me that, when at a work party, he groped her un-consensually, an event that was seriously traumatic for her (she has a history of dealing with SA, before knowing me). I, admittedly, had been a little jealous of how much she would talk about him, but after finding out what he had done, dedicated a lot of time to having long conversations with her about what he did, what she can do at work to avoid him, getting support from work friends, etc.\n\nA couple months after having those conversations with her (she had told me about this back in, like October), she told me that the night that he groped her, she was flirting with him. Nothing extreme, but some teasing, laying her head on his shoulder, resting her hand on his knee, etc. She was extremely apologetic for what she had done, and claimed her response was tied into the trauma she has experienced in the past, causing her to not think straight. All of those things I can probably forgive as like, some kind of platonic intimacy, but where I am struggling so much is that\n\n1. she didn't tell me for months\n2. she feels as if she did something that broke the trust in our relationship, something that went beyond just casual platonic intimacy.\n\nI don't know what to do. I've oscillated between feeling like it's not that big a deal and a really big deal. Truthfully, I don't see myself breaking up with her over this, but I'm really devastated by it I definitely harbor some resentment towards her over it. Idk what to do.\n\nAs a side note, but soon after she told me this, she caught COVID. I spent the next week taking physical and emotional care of her in my apartment. It was very difficult for me to have to do all of that and simultaneously suppress how I was hurt, which might be why I feel so lost right now.\n\ntl;dr -- my gf had cheated on me a few years ago, but after a break, i forgave her and we got back together. she just admitted to me that she had flirted with someone else a couple months ago and didn't tell me."

My GF (24F) and I have been together for 3 years in a long distance relationship and for the first 2 years things were more than great and issues only really occurred when we were apart due to emotional distress. Lately though, over the past year, things have been worse and worse. \n\nI've always been the one to stay calm during disagreements and try to be the rock, to keep us grounded and calmly discuss grievances, yet she raises her voice and gets so flustered over every little thing. Anytime she has a grievance with me, I inquire but ultimately and calmly accept it and work towards improving. Yet the few times I actually try to voice my complaints, she gets defensive and so upset to the point where she needs to leave and cool off. \n\nWe had a plan to move in together to another state after college, but she hates living with her parents and wants to move in together right away in her home state. Whenever I try to tell her it's a big deal for me to leave everything behind along with my issues with the state she lives in, she gets frustrated and upset without trying to understand how big of a deal this is for me. \"If you really love someone, you'd do ANYTHING for them.\" \n\nI don't feel understood or heard in this relationship, more like I'm always the one who is at fault.

Been single for the last 5 years with numerous women passing by but with no real spark to have a serious relationship which i truly wish for.\n\nLast month on a business meeting i met a girl (33) and we really hit it of on a friendly basis which quickly set off a really nice chemistry in the best way possible. We agreed to stay in touch and she contacted me a week ago to meet for lunch. \n\nWe had a really great time and opened up to each other completely. And here comes the problem; she is married 8 years with a guy that is almost 60 and has a daughter with him (7). She married him after a week of knowing him based on the fact that she has done everything what her surrounding expected from her during her life and she decided to do something completely unheard for.\n\nNow she realizes the burden of her choice and has been talking to her husband how to get out of their marriage. The problem is that they have accumulated a lot of wealth in between the time, especially him having the most of the wealth.\n\nMy friendly advice to her was to try to solve the situation in the best interest of the kid and then her, cause it is evident she cant spend her life with him. I told her not to entangle with anyone untill she is \"free\", cause if it goes sideways, the biggest collateral would be her child.\n\nThe problem i have is that i believe in the sincerety of her words and the fact that the way she looks at me is the way a man wants a woman to look at him. I felt that once in my life and i know how it feels and looks. I was completely shocked that day because i was almost sure i am never gonna experience that in my life again.\n\nI am not in love with her by any means, but i feel the potential it has, because i felt the connection from the moment we looked at each other the first time.\n\nNow we chat (initiated from her side) on a weekly basis and she is always complimenting me. I do not know how to respond to this. My gut tells me i should let her know how i feel but untill she is not divorced i cannot get into a situation like this.\n\nAdvice? Thank you!"

Such as his mouth and being allowed to throw tantrums to get his way.\n\nAs well I'm constantly cleaning up after the kid. I've asked him to help me, but he just whines. His dad tells him to help, but recently my boyfriend and the son's mom got into it because my boyfriend told him to help clean. Trust me I don't understand, why that was a big deal from the son's mom.\n\nI do understandable he is 4 years old. But I still think he is old enough to learn how to act and not throw tantrums. I don't know how to talk to my boyfriend about it. I don't have kids, so it's not my place.

We grew closer and closer, so I finally took the first step and confessed my feelings. He told me he still has to think about it because he wasn't sure if he felt the same way. He warned me that he was struggling with mental health issues and that he wasn't doing very well in general. I was so in love and of course I ignored it and said it wasn't a problem... After spending more weeks together he returned my feelings (this is our first relationship for both of us). Since then we still spend almost every day together.\n\nNow we come to the incident: I was visiting him, we talked a bit, cuddled and had a good time. Then we had a little discussion on an unimportant topic (we talked about our different sense of humor) where we had different opinions. So we were a bit grumpy but nothing serious. After that I decided to take a bus home earlier than planned because it was already very late.\nThen he started crying. I was shocked, hugged him and asked him what was going on. He told me he didn't want me to leave because of him. He thought I wanted to leave early because of the discussion. I didn't really know what to say. We stayed like that for a while, I told him I was worried that he was so dependent on me. He replied that he had warned me and that he doesn't want to lose me....\n\nNow I'm considering breaking up. He's incredibly important to me, but I think his mental health issues are bad for our relationship, both for him and for me. I only want the best for him. Is there a way to save our relationship? Or should I break up? If yes, how should I tell him? I want to keep being friends with him and you have to remember that we see each other almost every day at the university\n\nTLDR: I was visiting my friend whom I met about 2-3 months ago and he cried because I wanted to go home earlier than planned.

                "body": "My boyfriend and I have been together for the last 2 years and a half, and everything has been great the first year, but lately l've been thinking about our relationship. This past year a few things happened that made me think that he doesn't care about me as much as I thought he did. But I don't know if l'm being selfish and I expect too much or he's the one who's wrong. Let's start with the fight that happened 3 days ago. We both work and he's currently in a town 3 hours away from me for work, and he'll be there until the end of the Christmas holidays, which is around the 6th or 7th of January.\nUsually we're an hour away from each other. He's been there since the beginning of December, and he came to visit me the first weekend, almost two weeks ago. Then we planned that this week I was going to visit him, we both would decide a day so it worked for both of us. I have other friends in that town so I planned to spend the afternoon with them and the evening (towards 6 or 7pm) with him, I would spend there the night and we could spend the morning together before I would go home. So on Tuesday, two days before, he asks me when l'm going to visit him, and I tell him Thursday if it's okay with him and he says yes. The next morning we were on the phone and he asks me again when l'm going there, I say tomorrow, like we agreed, and he says okay that's perfect. He calls me again that afternoon and after a while talking he asks me if l'm for sure coming tomorrow. I'm a little confused at this point but I say yes, and he says that he agreed last night to have dinner out with his cousin tomorrow, but that I could go with them. At this point l'm a little pissed, but I just ask why didn't you tell me sooner? And he said he forgot. So I ask him to cancel with his cousin, that I don't particularly like, also because of our jobs we wouldn't be able to see each other again before the end of the holidays, Christmas makes our jobs much more busy. Also his cousin lives close to that town, and he sees him often. So I told him no, that I wouldn't go with them, I just wanted to spend time with him, I didn't want to spend the whole evening listening his cousin talk. I also forgot to mention that he told me that he had to work in the afternoon, and could only see me in the evening, that's why I planned to see my friends in the afternoon. But he got pissed and said that it wasn't fair that I got to spend time with my friends and he couldn't see his cousin (he see that guy almost every day now). But after a while he agreed that it would only be the two of us but I had to find a restaurant because he doesn't know any places around there and I had to call and make reservations right now because he didn't want to cancel with his cousin for nothing. And I was like if you think seeing me it's nothing l'm not coming don't worry, enjoy dinner with your cousin. And we didn't talk the rest of the day. The next day, I was supposed to go there but I didn't, and he texted me around noon asking me what I was going to do. I told him \"I'm not coming\" and he had the audacity to ask why. So I told him that I iust didn't feel like it and he told me that I was acting like going to see him was a chore and then he was like \"okay we'll see next time if I feel like visiting you\" So I told him not to bother and we didn't speak again. It's been three days and I don't know what to do. I really felt like while I was organizing and planning he really didn't want me there. And other things that bothered me this year he didn't get me a present for my birthday, our anniversary and last Christmas. I always get him presents in those occasions because I care and I like to see his face when he opens them and I think that that's a normal thing to do. But when l asked him why he just says that he never knows what to get me. Even when I told him last Christmas that it doesn't have to be nothing big, just anything that shows that he cares. But he just doesn't.. bother. And was just accepting it because he really didn't seem to have a clue but now I feel kinda dumb. \nAnd it's not even a money problem because he always offers to pay when we're out together, even if we take turns to pay every time. And the first year we were together he got me a gift for my birthday, one for Christmas and one for our anniversary, and they were beautiful. He also slapped me once but he was drunk and I forgave him, I feel pathetic now. \nOf course there's also a lot of positive things, I feel great when I'm with him and we laugh a lot and we talk about everything, I feel like he's my best friend.\nJust thinking about breaking up with him makes me want to cry and I miss him after these three days of not talking. But I hate to feel like he doesn't care.\nMaybe I should say that he's my first boyfriend, and that I don't have any other experience.\n\nI really don't know what to do because I feel pissed but maybe l'm just exaggerating and we were even talking about getting married in three or four years, but now thinking about it just gives me anxiety.\n\nTLDR: I feel like my boyfriend doesn't care about me and I don't know if I should stay with him. \n\nI know it's very long and I'm sorry also forgive me if I made any mistakes, English is my second language.\nThank you to anyone who'll take the time to read and to anyone who'll answer!!"

                "body": "Throw away cause im deleting after.\n\nI have been dating my boyfriend for three years [both 25] and I feel like recently that he's losing interest. I am an overthinker and worrier, and would like some outside perspective that isn't anyone from work or my friends.\n\nI would like to say he is an amazing guy. We have similar interests, he is funny and kind. The best and only boyfriend I have ever had. However I feel like I am getting mixed signals to whether he is still interested in me.\n\nOur relationship isn't as progressed as other 3 year long relationships go. It's embarrassing saying that we haven't held hands, cuddled (unless I'm alseep-- I'm a light sleeper), or even had sex. The furthest we have done is a quick peck on the lips at the end of our dates. That kiss is 9/10 initiated by me. We haven't dropped the L-bomb either.\n\nWe started our relationship just before the pandemic hit, but surely we would have done more than kiss by now? \n\nI have tried sparking it. On our holiday together alone, walk in the bedroom with a towel on. No glance. Nose in his phone. He went straight for the bathroom after me.\n\nHe's taking longer and longer to reply to my messages, claiming that Messenger hadn't alerted him of my messages, but he's been chatting to other people fine (I can see when he was last active... and no one else is having issues getting notifications). He used to reply almost instantly when I messaged towards the start of our relationship. I still message back instantly, now I feel like I am coming off as desperate? And when I do get a response, it's short/hard to keep the convo going messages.\n\nBoth last year and this year he had been invited as my plus one for my work's Christmas party. Everyone has been wanting to meet him. I want my work friends to meet him. Both times he has declined, excusing that he has to be at work early the following day (I don't want to disclose what he does for a living) or babysitting.. I have been questioned by my work both years why I haven't brought my date... and it is getting to the point where majority believe that I am lying and he's not real. I understand that he has work, but myself and colleagues said that he could come and meet people, show his face for an hour or so and go home (that party started at 7- and work paid for everything so money wouldn't have been an issue, and the party is local so not far at all). I want him to meet them and show off my boyfriend. Can't do that if he's not there!\n\nMy friends at work have been saying to each other (behind my back) that I need to get laid, and I'm started to question if he is still interested in me?\n\nI like to think of myself as a beautiful woman. I am a pretty woman. But when your relationship is lacking physical intimacy or not spending as much time together or talking as you used to, it knocks you down a bit.\n\nI mean, last year, I had danced with a friend from work (at the first party he declined to) and felt I had more attention from him in one dance (nothing happened besides dancing) than my boyfriend of three years. And all I could think whilst dancing with my friend that it should have been my boyfriend there.\n\nMy colleagues thought I should have dated that colleague instead. Tried convincing me to set up a date (whilst with boyfriend still) to see if that went anywhere (I declined, obviously).\n\nI nearly ended it last year. Because it felt like he wasn't interested (I wrote a long paragraph) and lack of phycially intimacy (basically same reasons as today) and he came back with he would be better etc. It was everything I wanted to hear. Now that it's the end of the year, I feel like we are in the same boat as last year.\n\nWe don't talk about the future, and I am starting to get ready to move out year after next. He's said that he would prefer to live alone, at first. Hes not got a date of when he wants to move out by.\n\nDespite all that, I met both sides of his family and he's met mine (after months of asking to meet mine)... this year and there's talks of doing me going on a holiday with his family plus family events. So surely there must still be some interest there?\n\nI'm at a loss. Speaking to him about the issues last year hasn't changed anything. I'm struggling. And I have been so patient that I deserve an award. But I am not sure how much longer I can go for?\n\nIs he losing interest? Cause I feel like my nightmares are coming true.\n\nTldr. I think my bf is losing interest after no talks of the future and lack of physical intimacy after three years together."

(28 f) I used to find this shit funny in my younger years but now it's just become upsetting. \n\nIt's really tough to make friends as it is. In the past year I've moved away from a childhood friend group as I knew I was in a better mindset without them. I've made a completely new circle of friends, especially at work, although it's a lot to get used to I know its better for me & in general life has got better in other ways. I've been single for a few years, I've also mainly dated women! I generally do not mind being the third wheel and I actually want to make friends with friends partners. \n\nI've made a good friend at work (m 30) who has been married for a few years with a child.  About 2 months into our friendship, I'd start getting the odd random message stating things like 'I won't be online gaming tomorrow' etc (we game with a few friends) then it became my number & FB were being deleted / gaming systems of his phone. (The partner was going through his phone whilst asleep, he is now having to change passwords & not use FB on his own PC. Then  it becomes her messaging me essays, telling my friend she doesn't like me. Being awkward as hell when I did meet her. I'm aware she has a bad friendship group & that she has also been deleting his male friends off gaming system's & trying to guilt trip him when he does go out with them. He sticks up for himself & most of the time, does go out, because thats what she does. I also have another gaming m pal at work, who is not allowed out without his gf, she has to be everywhere, who's had to delete our messages about fucking gaming & energy drinks! I was seeing a lovely lass this year who's past controlling ex, controlled our fucking relationship. What is wrong with people, I get it I do I get the jealously but there is seriously nothing to be worried about. \n\nIt's also giving me this racking anxiety.

I can‚Äôt remember what brought it about but she told me she was depressed and it‚Äôs getting in the way of a lot of things (I‚Äôll go into further detail later down). Immediately I brought up the idea of psychiatry and therapy, I told her I would do all the work for her, look for a therapist for her that fits with her health insurance and pay for her first appointment. She seemed interested in the idea. I gave her options, helped out, cooked for her, cleaned the house, and got her a self help book. I even tried helping her find a new hobby and gave her a bunch of art supplies and a mini lecture on how to do block printing (which she gave up on after 15 minutes). After all of this she still doesn‚Äôt put in any effort into looking for self help, she hasn‚Äôt glanced at the list of therapists I suggested and she has not once opened the book I got her. Instead she sits around on her phone and watches tik tok all day. She‚Äôs been way less affectionate and has lost what little intimacy she once had.

                "body": "Sorry in advance for poor formating since this is written on mobile. \n\nI(30f) have a rather complicated relationship with my MIL(60's), so I'll try to keep this short.\n\nSome back story.  My husband(34m) comes from a large family and he is one of six biological brothers. They adopted one girl when she was a baby and then when my husband and I got married his parents adopted another 5 who are all related. In comparison to my husband's family I come from a small unit. I have two younger brothers, so I'm the oldest. I'm really close with my whole family. I have been married to my husband for 9 years and we have two kids.\n\nAlright to the main story. Last Christmas we spent the holidays with my in-laws. I feel very VERY uncomfortable with them. When I first met them they legit could care less and never really talked to me or even got to know me, even considering that I was the first girl my husband brought home. Mostly my MIL.\n\n So we got an airbnb because staying at their house is stressful since my husband's family is huge. My MIL made a big deal about having the rest of the family stay at her house but could careless if my family stayed. At the time I didn't care, but one of my SILs asked me if I was ok and thought it was weird/mean that my MIL did that. Honestly, it was ok because I didn't have to battle her on it and the Airbnb had far more space and it was really close to their place. But it did raise my eyebrow.\n\nMy MIL never really talks to me. She is usually in the kitchen cooking or \"cleaning\". I say \"cleaning\" because her house is FILLED with expired food that she hordes. It's a mess. So basically all she feeds everyone is expired food. Needless to say, a lot of us don't eat or eat out a lot when we visit. \n\nAnyways, I figured that if we were going to talk   (trying really hard to have a good relationship with her) I would have to initiate it. Oh also, my FIL found out he had COVID when we got there. So... Yeah. So I'm talking to her (really painful small talk) I ask her how my FIL is doing and she legit just walks away from me. Weird.\n\nNext afternoon we go over and my oldest kid is freaking out about possibly having a UTI. I ask if it hurts and they are CRYING. The quickest thing I can think of is pain meds. My MIL is sitting on the couch and I ask her \"Do you have any children Tylenol? My oldest needs it\". Without saying anything she stands up and walks to the kitchen to look for meds. I follow. Then one of my SILs is in the kitchen and starts talking to my MIL about balsamic vinegar and my MIL is wrapped up in this conversation while holding the children's Tylenol. Totally forgetting my existence. I get her attention and get the Tylenol, but I find out that the damn stuff has be expired since 2013. Naturally I'm pissed. Run the the store grab stuff that's gonna help my kid.\n\nWe left back to the Airbnb for a little, naturally upset my MIL doesn't acknowledge my existence or even show concern for my child. So when we go back over my husband tells his mom that I'm upset that she has walked away from me mid conversation. She legit said \"Sorry I don't have time to talk to everyone\" in a very intense voice and then she walks away. Wow. \n\nI go to the car and cry. Frankly I'm done. We pack the kids and I went back into the house to grab my kids shoes. Infront of EVERYONE while I am obviously emotionlly dysregulated she trys to hug me. I turn her down and say \"Please don't. I'm getting my stuff and leaving\". \n\nFast forward to earlier this year, there was a family event for my nephew and it was the first time I saw my MIL since Christmas. She literally ignored me. Didn't even say hi to my kids. Super weird and awkward. My husband got a new car and naturally wanted to show his mom. While he was out showing her she said to him that she \"doesn't know what to do with me\". Kinda made my husband mad because she turns down anytime I try to connect with her and she is very critical of me. I'm kinda weird and different.\n\nI am so confused. We had another family event around July and she said hi to me and it was awkward.\n\nNow she is commenting on my social media posts like nothing happened. I am going to be seeing her briefly for the holidays and I can't wrap my brain around how confusing this woman is. \n\nDo I just go along with it and pretend that nothing happened or do I have an honest talk with her that this is confusing?\n\nTLDR: MIL ignored me while I visited for Christmas and the next time I saw her. Now she is acting like nothing happened after nearly a year of not talking to me."

He has to speak his mind, no matter how rude/ mean it is. He will almost constantly comment about my weight, make fun of my thighs being larger/ the shape of them, wishes he was dating a skinny girl, jokes around about leaving me for a skinny girl. He will call me really mean and nasty names when he is angry. I have expressed so many times how much this stuff upsets me‚Ä¶ he blames his OCD and tells me they‚Äôre just words. When it does get to me I‚Äôll cry‚Ä¶ which only makes the situation much much worse. He will just get very angry and won‚Äôt console me. \n2. He needs constant reassurance, while I am never reassured about anything. When he says the words above ^ I feel insecure and bad about myself. When I seek reassurance he gets angry with me and if we are talking on the phone will often hangup on me.\n3. He has to have pretty much complete control of everything at all times. If we have plans to go do something and something happens where we can‚Äôt fulfill those plans‚Ä¶ well let‚Äôs just say I get verbally assaulted/blamed for the situation every single time and a huge argument erupts. He will rearrange my home (he doesn‚Äôt live here) when I specifically will ask him please not to. \n4. I often do not get a say in anything we do. He will come over with plans already set about what we‚Äôre going to do and never bothers to ask me what I would like to do. \n5. When one of his routines are interrupted, whether it be my fault or not, I get screamed at and snapped on. This happens almost every time we see each other. \n\nI am trying to be so patient with this man‚Ä¶. but it‚Äôs really wearing thin.

Lately he has been getting really annoyed if people don‚Äôt keep it tidy, or leave personal affects in there. This week someone (probably my 14 year old sister) left a pair of socks in there. And my partner took it upon himself to bin them as he was ‚Äòtidying up‚Äô and they had been there for a couple of days. \n\nNow the messiness does get on my nerves, but we‚Äôve almost finished saving our deposit on the house, paying very low rent to be able to do so - so we won‚Äôt be here much longer. \n\nHe then admitted it to my family when the question was asked who binned the socks. Which was followed by an awkward silence. When they left I had a go at him for binning the socks, saying he could have just put them outside the door, or put them by the wash if he was feeling especially kind.

As someone who struggles with social anxiety, and who's always being described as shy, I purposely chose this job because I wanted something to help me grow and hopefully become better in this aspect.\n\nThe thing is I thought I was doing okay and I was actually kind of proud of how far I've come in a lot of ways since starting this job. But then I made the mistake of asking my coworker (24F) who is know for being very honest and very direct, what others think of me. She is also the person who everyone always comes to. So she's the one who knows everything about everyone.\nFor context she was talking badly about another coworker, who seems to be hated by everyone for good reason tho. She was really awful to a lot of people unfortunately. Anyway I felt kinda bad and was wondering if our other coworkers hate me as much as they hate her. That's why I asked.\n\nShe told me mostly negative things, a lot of things I agree with. Like how it took me longer than everyone else to really become confident and comfortable with what I'm doing and not having to rely on my coworker for help. Or that I'm still pretty shy and have a tendency of not talking or engaging when we're a bigger group. Or a few times where in hindsight I wasn't forthcoming to my coworkers and kinda scared of social interactions so I weasled myself out of something I should have done. Or I apparently sometimes sound sassy or unfriendly when talking to costumers which is not my intention at all.\nThe only slightly positive thing she said is that these problems are less there now compared to the beginning. \n\nI feel pretty bad about all of this. I genuinely want to improve myself in these aspects but also now I feel like everyone dislikes me and thinks I'm bad at my job. Which in turn makes me scared of going to work again.

From the start I made it clear I had some boundaries. One included I wanted a Muslim husband who didn‚Äôt drink alcohol. I have been raised in a non-alcohol culture. \n\nMy husband told me he stopped drinking once he converted (15 years ago). We spent time getting to know one another via families for over a year and there was nothing to suggest he drank. He did his prayers , Ramadan etc. \n\nWe got married. Things were decent. Never detected any drinking. Unfortunately few weeks ago, my husband‚Äôs dad passed away. On the day we went to see his family. Whilst I was consoling my MIL, I noticed my husband had left for a while. He came back reeking of alcohol. I privately asked him if he had a drink. He replied ‚Äúyes‚Äù. Deep down it wasn‚Äôt nice to hear but I thought maybe it is a one off and his father just passed away few hours ago so to cut him a break. \n\nThen soon after husband decided to invite his family over for dinner. As I was preparing dinner, my husband popped out with his cousin for about 20 minutes. He came back and seemed weird. He was speaking to his family as he had only just seen them first time and was slurring a bit. Then he went into the bedroom. I went and I asked if he was okay and if he had been drinking? He said he didn‚Äôt drink but just passed out fast asleep. I was left to host his large family alone.\n\nFew hours later on the same day we all heard some thud sound. I went and noticed my husband was in the bathroom. He had fallen and he was showering whilst drunk. I helped him and he went to bedroom and fell asleep. The following 3 days he was just sleeping and at midnight disappearing somewhere for 30 minutes or so. I would wake him up at dinner time to ensure he ate. He would smell of alcohol.\n\nThen one day he is sober and says he has been self medicating and it isn‚Äôt helping his grief. I reassured him that I will help him and was glad he saw the light. \n\nHowever, the next day I suspected he began drinking again. As I could smell it and he was crashing out again. To the point he was missing out on his mother‚Äôs doctors appointments and the funeral arranging appointments. All of which I attended on his behalf. Naturally, his mother was upset and she would share her concerns with me. I didn‚Äôt tell her about the drinking.\n\nI asked my husband ‚Äúhave you been drinking? If you have, I won‚Äôt judge you, but just so I can help you in the right way‚Äù. He told me he hadn‚Äôt been drinking. During this time my own mother had some problems of her own. So I was dealing with my husband being drunk, helping my MIL and mother and also organising a catholic funeral. Bare in mind I‚Äôm not catholic so all this is new to me. As well as going to work and doing the usual household chores. This carried on for few days. My husband being drunk (him denying drinking), passing out asleep, randomly leaving home at night and randomly tripping where I would have to lift him up. \n\nOne day I notice my husband is sitting with coffee spilled all around his feet. It has been two weeks since his father had passed. I clean it up and I discover under the table there is an empty bottle of vodka. I got annoyed and told him this wasn‚Äôt the answer. I also was annoyed because he had been drinking in the same room as the Quran. I said I needed the night to myself. I left that evening to stay the night at my mother‚Äôs. I got an angry text from him saying I deserted him when his father died. I went back. He is awake but drunk. I got him some food and tucked him in bed after. I also booked him an appointment with the doctor as my husband told me he was struggling. \n\nThe next day he was sober and came to me and said he felt guilty. That he was running away from the funeral, his mother and put a lot on my plate. Immediately I reassured him it was okay and I was here to support him to help him face the reality and help his mother. We agreed drinking wasn‚Äôt the answer.\n\nThings were decent for few days. Then one day I smelt alcohol from him again. I asked him. He denied it. In fact he got rude telling me it was in my head. I didn‚Äôt say anything back. I was civil to him afterwards and didn‚Äôt mention this topic.\n\nThe next day (3.5week since passing) I discovered a beer bottle cap. I confronted my husband. I told him he had lied to me and gaslit me into thinking it was in my head. He once again disrespected our faith by drinking in the house right in front of the Quran. He began to get rude. I told him I had enough and I couldn‚Äôt keep compromising on my faith beliefs for him any more. And that he has become a liar. He got rude to me and he hit my wrist and dragged me. I fell and hit my head and his response was ‚Äúgood you deserve it‚Äù. \n\nThen he calmed down and we spoke. I told him I think he is beginning to develop an addiction  and he is burying his head and needs to face the death of his dad as the funeral is only some days away. And that he needs to support his mother as she is grieving too. I also told him if drinking is his coping mechanism and he will continue doing it then our marriage won‚Äôt work in the long run.  He was willing to work on it. We agreed the next day we will pray together. \n\nThe next day we prayed our 5 prayers. I went out for a bit. When I came back, my husband is talking to me and I notice his speech is slurry. I asked if he drank, he said no. I accepted his answer. We both went to sleep and at one point I get up thinking I can smell alcohol and it‚Äôs coming from my husbands mouth. I go to the living room and noticed there was an empty large bottle of wine. My husband came in and saw I discovered it. I didn‚Äôt say anything at all. He start yelling at me and put his coat on and left home. Hours went by. I went out looking for him. He was in the parking lot in his car. He was passed out on the drivers seat with another large empty wine bottle. His key was on the seat and his door was half opened. He reeked of booze. I was really nice to him when trying to get him up and bringing him home. Mentally I was struggling however, as I am not used to drunk people and have not been bought up in an environment where there is booze. \n\nI bring him home and he starts yelling at me that I was purposely trying to shame him. I reassured him wasn‚Äôt trying to. I did him that I believe he now has a drinking problem based on how much he is drinking daily. The funeral is also less than 40 hours away and he still has not sorted his speech and currently is passed out drunk. \n\nI‚Äôm at this point where I feel stuck. A part of me wants to walk away from this marriage because it conflicting with my faith and I made it clear before marriage that alcohol was a big no no. I feel overwhelmed dealing with his drunk behaviour and he has become rude and now has put his hands on me. Didn‚Äôt even feel remorse. On the other hand, I do care for him and don‚Äôt want to see him go in a downward spiral. \n\nTl:dr. Both Muslims so alcohol is forbidden. Agreed before marriage that we are both non drinkers. After marriage, husband father died and husband starts to drink excessively, begins to lie and puts his hands on me. Downward spiral. Don‚Äôt know what to do."

                "body": "I (18F) have known my best friend, Michael (18M), for 5 years. We met at the start of high school in a large group of friends but started getting really close in our second year. I would spend almost every weekend at his house, go to his sport matches and we would hang out all the time during school. He is incredible. He had always seemed so shy and surly until I got to know him. In reality he's quirky and kind and compassionate. And he's got these super expressive eyebrows, I just love them so much. Every little arch they do makes my insides melt.\n\nAbout 8-9 months into us getting really close, my family and I immigrated to a different country on the other side of the world. I was devastated to leave him. Within a week of arriving in my new home I started to realise that my feelings for him weren't altogether platonic. We continued to text almost everyday and video called once a week. We exchanged birthday presents and flowers for Valentines day, while slowly building up this very flirty little long distance relationship.\n\nAbout a year and a half after the move I confessed that I had feelings for him and to my absolute delight he felt the same way. Despite this 'life-altering' revelation, nothing much changed; we continued on just as we always had, except that the flirty texts were no longer hidden under ten layers of sarcasm. We never officially called it dating, it seemed hard to at that distance; no way to go out or kiss or even hold hands. But we did have a non-verbal agreement that we were waiting around for each other. This went on for about a year.\n\nFast forward to a few months ago. At this point my family were planning on returning to visit for the first time since we'd left (3 years). We had been excitedly planning our reunion and all the things we wanted to do, like go on an actual date. I finished high school (he still had a few months left, I was put forward a little when we moved for ease of transition) and started university. All the while, I started to feel things shift. Being in university and making new friends (moving to a foreign country right before a pandemic does not make life easy) gave me a newfound freedom and I was really happy and feeling like myself again. As I got busy starting uni, Michael got busy with final exams and we had less and less time for messaging and weekly calls. At some point I realised I was no longer falling asleep dreaming about him, or fantasising about what life would be like if he were around.\n\nI made a decision; we sat down on a call and I told him I loved him (we had said that before this) but that I felt it was only as a friend and that I wasn't sure I had romantic feelings for him anymore. I explained that since I'd started working and studying I felt like I had grown a lot as a person. And realistically we wouldn't be able to have a real relationship. We would've spent a few weeks together before going back to our long distance lives. My hope that he had secretly felt this shift too was dashed. He was shocked and a little disappointed, but said that with time things would be easier. He still loved me too and valued me as a friend. He said he appreciated my honesty. It was important for me to tell him before I arrived back, because of all the plans we had discussed and expectations that had been set.\n\nAnd much like when I had told him I liked him, life continued on as normal. University assignments piled up, he went into a study induced hibernation period for finals, but all the while we kept talking. But then something strange happened. Life got quiet again, the Christmas break rolled around and suddenly I started thinking differently about him again. Dreams returned and I had to restrain myself from throwing suggestive quips into our conversations.\n\nHelp me fellow Redditers. I've got three weeks left before I arrive back for a four week holiday. Do I tell him that my feelings have returned before I get there or do I wait and see what happens when we're around each other again? Or do I perhaps say nothing at all? He's my best friend and the last thing I want to do is hurt him, but I'm also scared I'll throw away this small window we have to see if we work in person.\n\nTLDR: Had feelings for LD best friend, told him, feelings changed, told him, then feelings came back. Should I tell him before I visit in three weeks? (first time seeing each other in three years)\n\nEdit: forget to add the 'first' to above sentence"

He said he's been under a lot of stress lately with work, the holidays, his pets, and family. He reassured me that he still loves and cares about me and apologized for being distant. Finishing with that he's sure he'll be back to himself after Christmas. \nSo, I asked him if he could just send me a heart sticker or something once a day because my anxiety is bad and I like to know that things are still good. He agreed and I thought that was the end of it. He didn't follow through with it. So naturally my overthinking and anxiety got the better of me and I posted a picture about the \"three day rule\" on my Instagram story. He confronted me about it, obviously sad and upset by it. \nI got angry at him too, bringing up that he couldn't even do the littlest thing for me and I asked for him to tell me what he really felt towards me. He said that whenever he gets stressed and sad his response is to shut down and not think of anyone or anything. I immediately realized I was being childish and mean after and wrote him an apology. He hasn't looked at it yet and, maybe it's irrational, but I'm worried he won't come back. I'm worried that he thinks I hate him now and don't want to be with him. \nI'm not sure what to do.

Our friendships would get really difficult because the guys would have to be on the phone with their girlfriends apologizing for a few hours after hanging out with me. One of the girlfriends blocked me on twitter, another unfollowed me on all social media despite us having been acquaintances for years prior. In none of these cases were any of us ever flirty, and in all the cases I knew the girls and thought we had good relationships.\n\nThe fourth time was different because I had a one-time hookup with a longtime friend, decided it wouldn't work, and remained completely platonic after that. He started dating a girl and when she found out about the hookup, I was banned from hanging out with him and even being in the same room as him. I understand where hesitation around having us be close friends comes from, but he and I shared a large part of our social circle and it really stung to have to lose out on seeing a group of people I was close with.\n\nThis isn't a problem I know of anyone else having and I want to know if there's anything I can do to prevent this from happening in the future. If the problem is me, I want to reflect and build healthier relationships with people. Or is this just so common that nobody talks about it?

                "body": "My fiance Amy and I have been together for 10 years. When we first met she had a girlfriend and she was only with women before. It turns out we had a spark and I was able to talk her into ending it with her girlfriend and start seeing me. \n\nThe first 5 years of our relationship was amazing. She still had an attraction to women so as long as I was involved we invited women into our bed and had our fun. There was one girl in particular Christina (25F) that she particularly liked and she became our only 3rd partner for the next year. But I didn't think anything of it at the time, which looking back was foolish of me. \n\nAmy sat me down 4 years ago and said though Christina and her didn't go behind my back and cheat, Amy had strong feelings for her and thought she might actually be a lesbian. I asked her if she was breaking up with me and she said she wasn't but she wanted to temporarily take time apart so she can explore her feelings with Christina because she felt a strong connection.\n\nI was so in love with her and we'd been together for 6 years that I got her to agree to staying with me and not moving out. And that we could open up the relationship so she could explore these feelings with Christina. Told her this would be the best for her too since we live in NYC and rent is insanely expensive here and I was already covering all the bills. Amy to her credit tried to keep our relationship exactly the same, we still lived together, were affectionate with each other the way a couple would be, she'd even invite Christina a few times over so the three of us could play. But once or twice a week, she would leave for a date night or even spend the night with Christina. \n\nThe resentment built for a year and one morning when Amy came back home after spending the night with Christina I asked her if this goes both ways and I'm able to see other girls too. I don't even think I had the right to be angry because I'm the one that came up with this stupid idea. She was taken back by the question but said it was ok if I wanted to date too and we keep things between us the same. I tried tinder and bumble for a few months and did some casual dates but I didn't really like anyone too much. I wasn't even interested in anyone, honestly looking back I just wanted to hurt Amy. \n\nSo that's what I did, I did some research online and hired an escort over that was even younger and more beautiful than Amy. I timed the appointment at a time so Amy would come home from work around the time the escort and I were in our bedroom. By the time we were done and I was walking her out Amy was in the living room drinking a glass of wine. She kissed me good night and to call her back and left.\n\nAfter she left Amy asked me who she was and wtf I was doing I just lied and told her it was a girl I'm seeing for some fun just like her and Christina. She said this was different and she at least tried to be respectful and not rub it in my face and kept it out of the house. We argued for a few hours, she cried, we screamed, and went to bed angry. \n\nThe next morning she tearfully told me she just wanted to stop all of this. Said she would end it with Christina and we could just be a normal couple. Said seeing me with another woman was incredibly painful for her and she didn't want to experience that again. I agreed that I wanted that too. She ended it with Christina which ended up being a more difficult than we thought. Christina blamed me and would not stop reaching out to Amy to rethink things and even reached out to me a few times calling me a all kinds of names. \n\nAfter that we've slowly gotten to a good place again. A few months ago, we found out Amy was pregnant and we should be welcoming our baby boy around late spring. Don't plan on having a big ceremony but something small for the family and getting married around February. \n\nBut I've had this nagging fear for the last few years that Amy will still wake up one morning and decide she's a lesbian and leave me. Ever since we found out  we're expecting, this has become more than a nagging fear. It's been bothering me a lot actually. Even with Amy being great I start thinking, is she overcompensating because she has feelings for women and trying to be hetero?  Do you guys think I have reason to worry?"

Today when i told her how much I appreciated her, she said that the stuff I say means a lot to her but that I say it too often. On one hand i totally get her but on the other hand I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm comfortable with that. In the past I was in relationships that weren‚Äôt really anything serious but with her I feel complete and one day would love to marry her. Because of that I often get the urge to tell her how beautiful she is or how much I love her. I tell her things like that about 2 to 3 times a day. I could stop but I have so much feelings for her that sometimes I can‚Äôt hold it in and just have this urge to tell her how i feel about her.

My personal issues are when you asked me when I would turn ‚Äúfull lesbian‚Äù which is not something I am or will ever be. Just because I identify as bisexual does not mean I will ever flip the switch one way or another. It hurt my feelings a lot as I told you my sexuality in confidence and didn‚Äôt expect it to be made the butt of jokes at times. Additionally, I struggle with the main topic of our friendship being about my relationship status, and finding me a boyfriend. I understand your concerns but I can not handle having a boyfriend at this time in my life. I don‚Äôt necessarily need relationship advice about my dating life and I‚Äôm becoming weary about sharing more due to your constant criticism of my exes. \n\nSecondly, I am not okay with you referring to the black gnomes on your coffee mug as ‚Äúcultural gnomes.‚Äù It comes off as racist and insensitive when I know you‚Äôre trying to mean well and aren‚Äôt trying to be racist. But it is crossing a line that is not okay with me.\n\nThirdly, I am not okay with the last conversation we had about transgender people. It once again feels insensitive and transphobic especially wondering if they‚Äôve had gender reassignment surgery. These conversations are hard to navigate but I think that it‚Äôs difficult do manage when correct terminology isn‚Äôt being used and the events are being relayed second hand. \n\nFinally, I have a major issue with you pathologizing my mental healthand believing you are entitled to know every aspect of it. It hurts my feelings when I‚Äôm called manic, insane, mentally unstable and such phrases. It has come to a point where I am becoming genuinely concerned if I‚Äôm not behaving in a way that is acceptable and normal which causes me great stress. \n\nI love you. You are my best friend but right now I am unable to be a good friend. For now, I would like a little space to figure out what I need to do personally. This is not meant to be an attack, and I apologize for it seeming like that. I just am unsure how to proceed when I feel like this."

She said she was gonna get us a couples therapist just the week before but then decided ending the entire engagement was what she wanted instead.\n\nI have this nagging feeling this happened because of her mom encouraging her to leave me.

They're all generally pretty good housemates, but two of them, let's call them B and D (both 19M) can sometimes be a little... inconsiderate. Making tons of noise, 'arguing' in the common areas even after I asked them to tone it down a little (not completely, it's just that the way they tend to do it means I can't tell if it's real argument or playing around, which triggers me slightly due to past trauma), fucking loudly in B's room when they both know we can all hear them from that room but can't hear them from D's room. They also do things like leaving the upstairs bathroom an absolute mess (though one of my other housemates admittedly does the same thing with the downstairs bathroom).\n\nThe current issue is the washer and dryer. Being in a relationship, B and D do their laundry together. They're travelling down to B's home city tomorrow, and so want to get all their washing done before then. They've taken over the washer and dryer for the past few days. I need to do my own washing, but I have significantly less. I don't own many clothes, all my clothes add up to one load of washing, and my mum taught me to never put in washing unless it's a full load (trying to get out of that mindset because I recognize it doesn't work with my current situation). This means that by the time I have a full load of washing, I have basically no clothes left. Which is the current situation. The housemates in question know this, as I had asked if there would be time I think yesterday for me to get my washing in between their loads of washing. At the time, when D said there wouldn't be, I said it'd be fine because I didn't have plans on going out so I can just chill in my room in an oversized hoodie. I had thought I'd be able to do my washing by now. But I have not. B and D keep just leaving their stuff sitting in the washer and dryer instead of sorting it out, taking ages to get to it. At this rate I'm going to have to either wait till tomorrow to do my washing or do it at some stupid hour early in the morning if I actually want to have clothes tomorrow. (It's currently about half ten).\n\nI'm going to just leave this situation alone for now, I was just relaying the story to give an idea of the sorta things that annoy me. What I would really appreciate is advice on how to handle similar situations going forward. I'm not very good with words, which leads to me coming off as bitchy when I don't intend to be. (You know how phrasing something slightly different makes it comes across with a totally different tone, like \"I'm okay with doing your washing up' vs \"I'm totally fine with having to do your washing up\". That sorta thing.)\n\nI'm constantly worried about fucking up with my wording because they're good friends of mine, it's just these small things, and because I don't know how to bring them up, I just leave it, which leads to me getting more annoyed about it.\n\nFor an extra bit of context, everyone in the house is some form of neurodivergent. Autism and ADHD for most of us. Which can make navigating some situations harder, because of \"clashing autisms\" as one of my housemates had called it in the past."

I just say \"nothing\". They are convinced I'm up to something (I don't know why) and won't let it go before declaring that I'm on my phone because I'm sulking. \n\nNow, I'm really mad. They determined that I'm \"sulking\" and in the wrong and it doesn't matter how many times I remind them, that we're two people who are supposed to love eachother and they keeps shouting at me for pausing a show because they are talking and I can't hear. Either stop talking or stop telling me how you think I feel or just leave me alone. All I want is to not fight over stupid shit. \n\nThey keep on and on until eventually I snap and start shouting and then leave to go to the bedroom. I just need to be away from them because I'm hurt they have made nothing in to something and as per usual, it's all my fault. Not some of my fault, some of theirs - ALL MY FAULT. How they came to this conclusion they STILL won't say.\n\nThen they had the audacity to text me that I'm too emotional and I shouldn't drink anymore because they are fine and I'm an \"emotional wreck\". We've had 2 drinks. We live in the UK, drink alcohol like maybe once or twice a month at most and I don't know anyone who is drunk after 2 drinks. Their comment really irritated me because I know, that they know, neither of us are drunk at all. So why try to blame me for that? Neither of us are anymore than slightly buzzed. Although, I just feel angry now. I try so hard to please them, to be useful and to make them happy. They talk to me like I don't matter and it's just so hurtful. \n\nI know I'm not close to perfect but I don't see what I've done to cause this response this evening or why it was worth ruining the whole evening. \n\nI don't know if I'm missing something here and it is me, or if my partner is just being unreasonable. \n\nI also don't know how to fix this and to be honest, I don't want to be the one to go and say I'm sorry AGAIN when I don't feel like I've done anything wrong, because I don't want them to feel like they are right and I'm wrong. I know that's not what's important but I guess I just want to see them taking some accountability and if I go and apologize I know that won't happen. This is what usually happens. I'm always the one who has to apologise for every \"thing\" that we argue over. \n\nThis whole thing feels so dumb but I'm feeling the kind of petty where I wanna watch all of our shows without them and order a takeaway for just me (there's food to cook/ready meals in the house...I'm not a monster to let them be hungry). I think that would be mean as our money is shared but like...they've been mean to me all evening, why do I have to be nice when the whole reason I'm so upset is because of the way they have chosen to treat me? Ughhh. Now I'm being unreasonable. \n\nAm I missing something here? \nI don't know what to do...\n\nBinning a 6 year relationship over something so dumb seems equally as dumb, so please hold the \"dump them/ they should dump you\" comments people seem to get on here."

                "body": "I 22F) have been been with my boyfriend (22M) for 3 1/2 years now. We got together unexpectedly the end of our senior year of high school after I got out of a verbally abusive relationship that was beginning to get physical. I was not looking for a relationship and when we met we instantly clicked. For 2 years we rarely fought but there were so many issues I was having throughout the relationship that I was afraid to speak to him about (because of my last relationship). He's always had a tough shell and never really let me in, he didn't know what he wanted to do with his life and never wanted to go out or do anything unless it was him with his friends. Our first 2 years together we celebrated birthdays, holidays, extra. But, in the last 2 years he hasn't celebrated anything and told me every holiday was a waste of time and money even though I was getting him gifts. We worked through a lot of it but I always felt like I was 10steps behind him because he always told everyone around us what was going on in his life and usually they would accidentally tell me thinking I already knew. All of this we were able to mostly talk through but still bugs me frequently. I always got along super well with his family and he with mine and marriage was always a discussion on the table. However, when we both turned 21 he turned into a whole new person, always drinking heavy, ditching me to go party, canceling plans and would make comments to me about how \"I'm not worth marrying\" and that \" I'll never find someone else because nobody else would want to put up with me and my nagging\". when we would discuss it he'd brush it off that I was making a big deal out of nothing and it was just drunk words. I then noticed he was being weird about his phone (we never hid anything from each other so neither one of us ever had a reason to go through each other's stuff) so when this behavior was starting to get out of hand I regrettably looked through his messages. He was bashing me to his friends and was flirting with two women our age from his work and sending their pictures to his buddy's talking about how hot they are and making inappropriate comments. I brought it up and we talked about it, he cried and said it wasn't gonna happen again but I decided to break it off. We were split for around 2 weeks and I realized I wanted him back in my life and I wanted to fix it so we did and everything was getting better until October 2022 when I noticed he was messaging those girls again, but he kept telling me it was just work related (definitely wasn't). Our hobbies include going to a line dancing bar near us where I go dance and he plays pool and at the Halloween party a week later I met a really nice guy (21M) who has been nothing but kind to me these last 2 months of just friendship. Im starting to develop feelings for him now but im afraid that by breaking up with my boyfriend and chasing after him I am making a huge mistake that I may regret later. This new guy also tends to get a lot of girls numbers while at the bar and while he only hangs out with and dances with me, he still makes rounds getting their numbers and texting them. He said it's because im already in a relationship but I feel it could have a possibility of still being a problem even if I did break up with my bf. I feel like im gonna end up with a double heart break. I'm also really struggling with all of this being during the holidays as I don't want to ruin it for either of us.\n\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend (22m) and I (22f) of four years Have had a lot of relationship turmoil on his half involving secrets and other women that we have decided to work through. However, I very recently met somebody else as friends but I'm starting to develop feelings and I'm not sure if it's worth risking my relationship or if I should break up with my boyfriend for a chance at a fresh start with this new guy."

                "body": "Hello. \n\nI‚Äôm 25f currently in a LDR with 27m. \n\nWe met about a year ago online and liked each other enough that we continued to talk to each other despite not living in the same country. \n\nHonestly I was looking for something serious and made it very clear to him. He wasn‚Äôt necessarily on the same page as me at first but liked me enough that he decided to see where the talking took him. The relationship progressed and earlier this year I took a trip to meet him for the first time. Why me and not him? I had vacation and he had just changed jobs and it was too soon to say that he was leaving on vacation. It went well and we made our relationship official afterwards. It‚Äôs been long distance ever since it begun. We‚Äôve met up a couple more times. He visited me in my home country and we even had a trip together to Las Vegas. I‚Äôve met his family and has met mine. Whenever we have been in person, it‚Äôs been a very wonderful relationship. When we are apart, things get rocky at times. Right now we are at an impasse and my heart feels heavy and I need some advice.  \n\nLast week in the middle of a fight he broke up with me. It was very surprising. Ever since, he has apologized and explained that he didn‚Äôt mean to break up with me like that. That he didn‚Äôt mean the words that he said and regretted the outburst. What he meant was that the LDR was growing heavy on him and he was very conflicted about what it would mean to continue it. He says that the only way to end the LDR is to get married and buy a house together. A step that he is very scared to take because all of the relationships he has seen in his life have ended in divorce. That his parents‚Äô divorce made him cry a lot as a child and he doesn‚Äôt want to go through something like that. \n\nAbout getting married or moving in together he says, ‚ÄúI don't necessarily know that I don't want to take [that risk], it's just a tough call given that I'm not sure if [our fights] will either get much better or if we're committing to living with fights lest we break up and have to saw the couch down the middle as we look for new apartments‚Äù\n\nHe also says, ‚ÄúLike you usually say those things can be worked on, I can work on managing my emotions when I am triggered and you can work on finding and avoiding my triggers. I just don't know if the cost benefit for putting the work in to solve those issues for both of us lines up easier or worse off if we get to spend more time together‚Äù \n\nI didn‚Äôt understand this so I asked him to explain and he said, ‚ÄúBy the cost I mean how hard it would be to try to resolve those things, either it's easier because we're in person and we have more bonding and it works out better, or it's harder because we're in person and we can't escape the fight and it boils over worse, or other unpredictable reasons for either side. The benefit would be less if it's harder to resolve bc then the entire relationship is probably doomed. The benefit is greater if it's easy bc then the relationship would work well.‚Äù\n\nTo me it‚Äôs very difficult to understand his doubts. I don‚Äôt know why but I don‚Äôt think much about things going badly like he does. I know it‚Äôs a possibility but at the same time I‚Äôm not afraid that that‚Äôs how things will go. I must say that everyone I know hasn‚Äôt divorced so I don‚Äôt know what he must have seen growing up. \n\nHe says this, ‚ÄúI must clarify my doubts are not about how I feel for you right now, they're about the logistics of going farther into the relationship, the monumental next necessary step, and they're born out of fear from seeing basically every relationship I've ever witnessed in my life completely fall apart‚Äù\n\nEven though he says that, this whole impasse about possibly breaking up rests very heavy on my heart. A part of me thinks he is just prolonging a relationship that he‚Äôs already decided on not pursuing, but he says that‚Äôs not the case. He thanks me for my patience and that he needs some space to think about what he wants to do here. \n\nDo you have any words of advice for us? For me?"

So when he initiates sex during a depressive episode I feel very turned off by the stress and general low mood in the house.

We obviously need to talk about this as our needs are not matching up, but I‚Äôm not sure how to approach it. His love language is physical touch and wanting to feel loved when your in a depressed state is natural and valid.

Literally he is the best and always there for me, and always try to help him too when I can. The 2 of us are super close and talk about anything and everything and we mess with each other all the time. Often times I poke him a lot and kinda tickle poke? I guess you could say sometimes and we  both laugh and it's really funny and just what I do with people I'm close with. I do this all the time, even in our classes at school. \n\nNow the issue is, for the past few months I've been trying to help set him up with this girl in one of our classes that he really likes. She and him are both super shy and quiet, so I really had to go out of my way to slowly start to become friends with her and eventually get her snap chat and now finally get the 2 of them talking. Well now I've managed to give him her snap chat by creating a class GC on snap and he's talking with her. Yesterday however he asked me if I could invite her to sit with us so I did, and everything went fine. Or so I thought. Mind you I've mentioned to this girl multiple times that this guy is my best friend, but now last night he told me he had to ask me a favor on face time. \n\nMy friend told me that he doesn't mind when I mess with him, he thinks it's really funny and it doesn't bother him and he knows it's our thing and just a part of who I am, however he asked me if I could stop doing it whenever this new girl is around. \n\nI'm completely heartbroken and blindsided. He's worried that she will think it's weird that I mess around with him and doesn't want me to do it when she's around. He said I can still do it all the time, just not with her around. I cried all night yesterday and I'm still sad. My thing is I think it would look worse if she ever realizes I don't do this around her because he said not to. Like idk what to do. She literally is in the same class as us and can see us fooling around picking and messing with each other on a regular basis, but now if she sits with us (which I have to convince her to come over because he's too shy to do it himself) I have to restrict myself. \n\nAny advice would be nice.

We‚Äôve both always been pretty laid back with things, but after this long sometimes his lack of effort or thought just seems like he‚Äôs not bothering with me as much as I feel like I deserve. \n\nThere‚Äôs lots of things, he always runs late (I do too, but his late is several hours, mines usually 20 mins at most). When he is supposed to meet me at a certain time, he won‚Äôt tell me specifics of where he actually is. Usually he‚Äôll give me a list of things he needs to do before he can leave when he‚Äôs already late. Which is okay, but he only works 2 days a week and does nothing else the rest of the week, so surely he would do those things on the days he‚Äôs doing nothing? He won‚Äôt even set alarms in the morning. So he wakes up when he wakes up. Even with plans. \n\nHe also never makes plans for us, I always have to plan our dates and pay for most things as he doesn‚Äôt have money ( he has money issues right now, but still spends over a hundred ¬£ a week on üçÉ). Surely if you had to chose between that or getting the train to see your gf to make the plans she made, you would chose the gf. He‚Äôs only taken me on one date in the whole year I‚Äôve been with him. He also kind of takes his frustrations out on me about that stuff. Rarely, but it‚Äôs always been at me. \n\nAnother situation that was recent was that he told me he was going to come see me to give me my presents in a few days, (I work most days in the week and I‚Äôm also a student, so I brought his presents after I‚Äôd finished a long shift before going home). Today he told me, that he slept in (he works late two days in a row). So he usually does sleep in on these days. But apparently he‚Äôd decided that today would be the day of the week he‚Äôd wake up early to buy my presents (after working till 2am) and starting another shift the same day.

(We both come from muslim backgrounds although we don't believe.) He did not respect her decision and was telling her a little but to what I said that I do respect her choice and if that is the faith where she finds inner peace then so be it. While he was texting her, I told him to tell her that I do respect her choice though. To what he replies: \"tell her yourself\". I told him to give me her number since I don't have it (I was not gonna do it but I wanted to see what he said) to what he said\" really?\" And I said well, you told me to tell her myself, idk how to tell her otherwise then. I told him to add her in the call and he asked again \"really?\" And i said yeah it will be fun, I can finally meet her. He went like, no I dont feel like doing this now, we can do this another day I'm tired. I asked why? \n\nLike I want to be part of his circle, they all live abroad even his family but I want him to want me to be part of it. It's not that he doesn't want me to be part of his circle, it's just that he doesn't care if I am or not. Am I exaggerating? Because I did want him to meet my bffs and my family. He said if he does it hed do it for me not because he wants to because it's not in his nature. We continued arguing about how baffling it is to me to find out that he doesn't care. And out of nowhere he goes and says \"I SWEAR TO GOD YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS OF HER. You're jealous of her.\" That hurt so much because I never EVER said anything negative about the girl, in fact, I was hyping her for choosing Islam as her path. Why would i be jealous? I genuinely don't understand. Tbh, I'm starting to feel a little sus for this odd reaction.

I had previous relationships where we would slightly rush into a relationship but with this person she was playing the long game and I had one relationship where it didn‚Äôt seem to go anywhere and it wasn‚Äôt until afterwords where I found out she had feelings for me. I ended that relationship to be with her and it would be long distance where we would talk and get more intimate. It wasn‚Äôt until 2020 where we started taking things to the next level and was when I moved to a different state while she was in college living with her parents. She still does to this day and I currently go to college in the same state as her but completely opposite ends. We ended the relationship during my freshman year because we were long distance for majority of our relationship and I wanted to expand my views and wanted to see what I wanted in life.

I‚Äôve given them and even their friends rides throughout the relationship and continue to do so (my boyfriend has to remind them to say thank you), I compliment them when they get dolled up together, I say hello when coming into the house (which is followed by silence because they don‚Äôt say it back). And there was a point when I stopped, because it hurts. My boyfriend says to try and not let it bother me, that they barely even like him lol..but them being younger doesn‚Äôt dismiss the fact that it hurts when there is absolutely zero reciprocation. I would love to have a relationship with all of them, but it‚Äôs hard to want to even try and build one. His parents love me, as well as the youngest sibling, so no issues there. But it does feel awkward and tense when all of them are together say in the living room or something. I can‚Äôt help but feel unwanted and I‚Äôve even stopped going over to my boyfriend‚Äôs house as often as I used to, he usually comes to mine.\n\nI have 3 older siblings, and 1 younger so I‚Äôve never had to experience this.

She was the nicest cutest and most adorable girl I could have ever ask for, be it personality or looks she was in every way perfect to me. Also this is my 2nd relationship\n\nSo where shall I start? I ( 22 M ) have been with my gf ( 19F ) together for a year, basically she moved to a new place and found some new friends which Im really happy for and is adapting quite nicely. One of her friends lets call him Mark has been very nice towards her and I have a bad feeling.\n\nSo ever since they got to know each other she has been ignoring me more and more and prefers to spend time with him instead of calling me, which is totally understandable since real life interactions are better. I just feel so miserable I dont get any more good morning texts or good night texts unless I initiate the convo and tell her Im going to sleep and wish her a good night.\n\nThe issue really is that I have recently found out ( I stumbled across it by accident ) that she is lying to me whenever she says she is tired or whatnot excuse she has ready cause whenever I ask if we can talk she brings up an excuse but is at the same time playing with Mark and in a call with him. This really hurts me, I would rather get an honest opinion on why she is lying but I have asked multiple time and I never got a proper answer, also its really hard for me to fully trust her when she is lying about small things like these.\n\nShe broke the news to me she is moving to another continent for a year or so ( transfer stuff ), I told her waiting for her wont be a problem for me but lately shes been insisting that she doesnt want me to wait cause \" I shouldnt miss out on a chance for a new girl \" for the sake of waiting for her, now I really dont care sacrificing that if it means that I can stay with her. I dont know if my mind is playing with me and telling me that my gf and Mark have something going on, I really wanna trust her but like I mentioned its getting harder and harder to do so.\n\nI dont really know how to describe it but I feel like she just ripped my heart out and crushed it, ignoring my messages and answering a day or two later ( basically when she is not spending time with Mark ) I dont know how she feels but I would say I put alot of effort into this realationship and I really love her and she used to show me all the affection and love back at the start of it, but now the only thing I see is a cold shoulder. I dont know, I feel devistated I dont know what to do I feel like its my fault but whenever I ask her she says its not. Where have I failed? I really get more depressed the more days go by and I try to keep up the happy guy whenever I see or call her.\n\nI heart aches whenever I think about this topic and many people might call me a failure but I cried several nights on my own not knowing what to do, I feel sad, abandoned, emotionally crushed I dont wanna live like this, I would rather just ...\n\nThanks for reading it to the end, and let me know what ur thoughts are"

I was never asked if it was okay for him to be there on his own but now I feel like it‚Äôs too late to say anything since it‚Äôs been going on for a few months. I‚Äôm not 100% on the idea he‚Äôs there on his own especially since they‚Äôve only been dating a few months and so I have no reason to trust him I hardly know him but that‚Äôs the least of the problems now. \n\nWe each have our own toilet, mine is in the main hallway and hers is an en-suite, even though mine isn‚Äôt it‚Äôs very clear it‚Äôs my toilet (even has a sign) and so I am obviously in charge of cleaning it which I do a lot it‚Äôs always spotless. Therefore I noticed straight away when my toilet brush was covered (I can‚Äôt even explain how bad it was) in poo. and my toilet had clearly been very very used. This kept happening and so I confronted my flatmate and just asked her if she knew anything about it. She said she didn‚Äôt know why it would be that way and blamed it on her boyfriend and said she‚Äôd speak to him about it and so I left it at that. This toilet factor is important later.\n\nAs I mentioned before I‚Äôm hardly at the flat during the day on weekdays due to uni hours but I happened to be there a few days ago with my flatmate. Her boyfriend buzzed the flat to be let in and so she let him in but 4 other men walked in with him. My flatmate told me that she had no idea he was even coming over let alone all these men who I‚Äôd never seen before in my life. I felt a little disrespected since he didn‚Äôt even ask my flatmate (his gf) if he could bring these men into her house and turn up unannounced so after they had left I told her I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with people being at the property without both of us knowing. Once again she said she‚Äôd talk to him about it.\n\nYesterday was the last straw, uni term just finished and so I was at the flat during the day again, I was home alone since my flatmate was at work and I was about to have a shower when about 6 men just enter my flat, her boyfriend leading them in. He stopped as soon as he saw me and was like ‚ÄúI know this looks bad‚Äù CLEARLY startled that I was actually home and told his friends to go back outside. He left without saying a word to me.\n\nI was due to catch a train back home for christmas in the next hour and couldn‚Äôt stay to talk to my flatmate in person so I sent her a text explaining the situation and how uncomfortable it makes me which she ignored. I have my suspicions that this and the fact my toilet keeps getting destroyed are connected. I think he‚Äôs been bringing his friends over to our flat without my knowledge for a while now. \n\nSo my question is how on earth do I approach this?? Do I even have any right to do anything since they‚Äôre using her keys so are they her guests?? It makes me so uncomfortable I don‚Äôt know what to do. If they steal something I don‚Äôt think I can claim on insurance since they technically didn‚Äôt break in. I feel like this is going to completely ruin our friendship"

                "body": "Hi all,\nI'm using this medium to honestly just vent and express myself, kinda like putting my thoughts to the universe. Your opinions and advice are welcome of course. I just literary don't have friends.\n\nTL:DR \n\nOP has provided the wife with a comfortable lifestyle that the wife has not grown professionally or matured which is distress in the household.\n\n=========================================\n\nMy wife [31F] and I [33M] have been married for 6 years, before that we were in a relationship for well over a decade. We have two young boys, a 5-year-old and a 7-month-old. \n\nRelevant to the \"story\" of our education is the following: my wife has an associate's degree in liberal arts and I have an unfinished bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Additionally, I come from your typical working-class family, and my wife came from a poor single-mom household.\n\nBefore my boys were born my wife has been working for the same retail store for years, I've always encouraged her to make use of her associate's degree in a better-paying job or return to school to finish a degree. Her response has always been \"I don't know what I want \" and we left it at that. In the meanwhile, I've always been searching for better job opportunities whether it meant going up the corporate ladder or finding a new job entirely. \n\nFinancial speaking we always have been able to make meet ends. Of course, that all changed when our firstborn came into our life, my goal then has been to find better pay than the years past and I have grown considerably professionally that I was finally able to find a $40k job. In the meantime, my wife has stayed working for the same retail store, in similar roles, for roughly $30k a year.\n\nBy the time my secondborn came into our lives, I have taken that $40k and turn into a $52k job, and again, no significant change for my wife.\n\nThe year 2022 has proven extremely difficult for working families here in the USA. we almost lost our home due to the exaggerated increase in property tax, and our monthly mortgage had increased by $1,100.00. It took me 2 days to finally gather my marbles to figure out a way to reduce that without selling the home or getting into an expensive loan. \n\nIn the meantime, my wife was just telling me, \"we will be ok\", and \"we will figure it out\". I was so mentally unwell, that it began to manifest physically. I still feel like a failure because in my mind I think that had I been smarter and finished my degree I would not have found myself in this situation of almost losing the house. \n\nThen I began thinking even more, why am I the only one so interested in finding better pay for my family? I now feel like, my stress and sacrifices have provided my wife with such a comfortable life that she just doesn't seem to care about progressing financially and professionally. \n\nWorse is that in part of reducing expenses we agreed that she would have to only work on the weekends so that on the weekdays she could stay with the kids to cut on daycare expenses. You would think that the house would be clean right? No. I do more house cleaning on a Saturday than she does in the entire week. While taking care of the kids.\n\nNow I'm exhausted, as a father, as a husband, as a professional. I've gained a lot of weight, recently I had to double on heart meds. I've been begging my wife for a little more support that never comes. And it is causing me to think of a path in which she is not involved but for my kid's sake, I haven't taken any action. I honestly feel like this stress is going to cancel my life subscription if I leave it unchecked.\n\nIn my eyes, my wife remains like the same 16-year-old girl when we first met, but in the body of a 31 years woman, tossing all responsibility to me. She is a wonderful mother, I can't deny that. But she fears change so much that is hurting us.\n\nI know that some families operated under this premise. Man is the head of the household and the sole provider. But that is not how I want to raise my boys. I want them to understand that women are more than just mothers or objects. And during our relationship with my wife, we made it clear how we wanted to raise our family.\n\nI just reach a point now where I am lost and extremely unhealthy, not to mention unhappy.\n\n===================================== \n\nOk there. I got that out of my chest. Again, opinions are always welcome and any advice will be taken to heart and consideration."

They've been married for 30 years.\n\nEven tho he's being an asshole, having the family dynamic destroyed like that won't leave me indifferent, because most of my life I used to love him, I think I still do.\n\nIt's gonna hit hard emotionally in a few month max I anticipate from myself. It seems most of my family dealt with some of their emotions before I did. Pitfalls I could avoid ? Way to deal with it internally ? Thanks again"

We walk the dog together once a day 30 minutes to an hour, and that‚Äôs about all the quality time we‚Äôve had in a very long time. The rest of his day is spent working and then video games, averaging atleast 5-8 hours a day. We don‚Äôt do anything on the weekends and all I‚Äôve asked for is more quality time. For the first time in over a year he agreed to paint with me last night, where we would switch the canvas every 5 minutes. I went to his room and told him to come get me when he was ready. I waited 4 hours until I noticed he just wasn‚Äôt going to do it. So I went to get him. I asked to help me pick out some paint colors and instead he went downstairs (still playing his video game) and told me to do it. This upset me. We were supposed to do it together and instead he put it all on me, which took atleast 30 minutes for me to do alone. It would have taken 10 minutes with his help. At this point, it‚Äôs 11 o‚Äôclock and I‚Äôm sad that it‚Äôs already ruined. We‚Äôre both in a bad mood but I tried turning it around while we painted. He didn‚Äôt speak to me the entire time. Half way through, he got a stomach ache, so we stopped and he continued his gaming. No discussion was had since he wasn‚Äôt feeling well and he just avoided it when I brought it up in the moment anyways. We go to bed, I get over it because I‚Äôm just happy he made an effort and I wake up determined to have a good day and be in a good mood.\n\nJust now- driving to get food and he‚Äôs obviously upset. I ask what I did wrong and he gets frustrated telling me I‚Äôm not healthy and the fact that I woke up happy after getting upset with him last night is sickening. Calls me bipolar and says it‚Äôs my fault and he doesn‚Äôt like hanging out with me. Mind you, that all I‚Äôve asked for years is quality time and instead he just chooses to play games and does not come to me with things he‚Äôd like to do with me. I can‚Äôt sit in bed and wait on him to give me his time anymore. I got frustrated after I got excited that he finally said yes to doing something with me and instead made me do half of it alone and then stopped half way and just played his video games. I‚Äôve clearly communicated this several times and now I just don‚Äôt know what to do."

One of the dont‚Äôs is no spending money on porn. There‚Äôs so much free porn, there‚Äôs no reason to be buying it. As well as, we could be putting that money to savings or towards appreciating each other. \n\n\nFast forward a year in April 2022 I had tumor removal surgery and I wasn‚Äôt able to have sex with him. \n\nIn may I found out he‚Äôd been purchasing porn while I was unable to perform, and 2 of the girls were actually women we know irl‚Ä¶which hurt me alot. I had no idea he was looking at them sexually. \n\nAnyways, we got over that. He promised to never do it again and as far as I know he hasn‚Äôt. However he does still watch porn regularly. \n\nIt does bother me especially when I‚Äôm around and available. Why would you jerk off when I‚Äôm right here? That and the fact that he searches for specific women when looking at porn. He‚Äôs not just clicking a random video. \n\nI‚Äôm confused because he takes very good care of me sexually and emotionally. During sex he‚Äôs very intimate, loves to look into my eyes and tell me how pretty I am. \n\nMy point is, I‚Äôm not being neglected. But his frequent porn consumption really bothers me. Would it be wrong of me to ask him to stop taking his phone with him to the bathroom? I know he masturbates while he‚Äôs in there. I just think knowing he‚Äôs in there choosing porn instead of me hurts a lot. I know of course he will masturbate to porn when I‚Äôm not home, and that‚Äôs totally fine. But when I‚Äôm home just choose me instead of porn?"

We communicate everything, we get each other, and have so much fun. If we ever have a problem, we squash it right then and there. I‚Äôve never been worried about her cheating on me. She says she has never in any past relationships. I‚Äôm currently in another state for work. \nIncident: This morning she called and told me everything. Her and some coworkers went out for drinks and came back to one of their apartments to continue drinking. My girlfriend had a few too many and went to bed. One of the coworkers went to the room she was staying in and began talking to her. My girlfriend remembers making out with him and cuddling but her memory wasn‚Äôt very good due to the alcohol. She says that she doesn‚Äôt remember anything else happening and there are no signs of anything more. She went to bed with clothes on and woke up with the same clothes on. When she got back to her apartment this morning, she called said coworker and confirmed if what she remembers happened and nothing more. He confirmed making out, getting in bed and continuing to make out, cuddling, and him leaving because my girlfriend was intoxicated.\n\nAs of now we talked it out and are still communicating. I told her we would figure it out when I get home tomorrow night. She says she doesn‚Äôt know why she did it and has no feelings for this guy. I told her to cut off all communication with him, she obliged. She is remorseful and says she knows what consequences could come. I love this girl and see a future with her. This isn‚Äôt her and I think this is an isolated event. Am I taking this too light? I‚Äôm obviously hurt but feel respected because she told me as soon as she woke up.

She was the nicest cutest and most adorable girl I could have ever ask for, be it personality or looks she was in every way perfect to me. Also this is my 2nd relationship\n\nSo where shall I start? I ( 22 M ) have been with my gf ( 19F ) together for a year, basically she moved to a new place and found some new friends which Im really happy for and is adapting quite nicely. One of her friends lets call him Mark has been very nice towards her and I have a bad feeling.\n\nSo ever since they got to know each other she has been ignoring me more and more and prefers to spend time with him instead of calling me, which is totally understandable since real life interactions are better. I just feel so miserable I dont get any more good morning texts or good night texts unless I initiate the convo and tell her Im going to sleep and wish her a good night.\n\nThe issue really is that I have recently found out ( I stumbled across it by accident ) that she is lying to me whenever she says she is tired or whatnot excuse she has ready cause whenever I ask if we can talk she brings up an excuse but is at the same time playing with Mark and in a call with him. This really hurts me, I would rather get an honest opinion on why she is lying but I have asked multiple time and I never got a proper answer, also its really hard for me to fully trust her when she is lying about small things like these.\n\nShe broke the news to me she is moving to another continent for a year or so ( transfer stuff ), I told her waiting for her wont be a problem for me but lately shes been insisting that she doesnt want me to wait cause \" I shouldnt miss out on a chance for a new girl \" for the sake of waiting for her, now I really dont care sacrificing that if it means that I can stay with her. I dont know if my mind is playing with me and telling me that my gf and Mark have something going on, I really wanna trust her but like I mentioned its getting harder and harder to do so.\n\nI dont really know how to describe it but I feel like she just ripped my heart out and crushed it, ignoring my messages and answering a day or two later ( basically when she is not spending time with Mark ) I dont know how she feels but I would say I put alot of effort into this realationship and I really love her and she used to show me all the affection and love back at the start of it, but now the only thing I see is a cold shoulder. I dont know, I feel devistated I dont know what to do I feel like its my fault but whenever I ask her she says its not. Where have I failed? I really get more depressed the more days go by and I try to keep up the happy guy whenever I see or call her.\n\nI heart aches whenever I think about this topic and many people might call me a failure but I cried several nights on my own not knowing what to do, I feel sad, abandoned, emotionally crushed I dont wanna live like this, I would rather just ...\n\nThanks for reading it to the end, and let me know what ur thoughts are"

(that happened when i started a conversation when he had been drinking and i hadn‚Äôt, so i told him i thought we should stop because i was wrong to start it and not consider that he was intoxicated and it was unfair of me to try and have a conversation when we weren‚Äôt on an equal playing field, he said that was me blaming him for being drunk.) \n\nhe always apologizes later, and we‚Äôve talked a lot recently about how i‚Äôm scared to engage with him because of how bad his anger has been. when he‚Äôs not angry he agrees with me and tells me we can figure it out, and he tells me that i am trying hard enough i do apologize and he just gets so angry he lashes out and says i don‚Äôt and tells me i‚Äôm not trying hard enough but it‚Äôs not true. i ask him all the time now because i don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs true and what isn‚Äôt anymore, i don‚Äôt even know how to avoid making him angry anymore. \n\ni will say that i have been worse too, i‚Äôve had three funerals in the last four months alone not to mention the hundred other problems life has been dumping on my family. i have had much less patience and i‚Äôm really emotional all the time. i‚Äôve been trying to manage it but i‚Äôm pretty empty on the emotional capacity front which hasn‚Äôt made things easier. i talked with him about that and how i have given him a lot of forgiveness throughout our relationship in relation to his anger and now i need him to have more patience for me. i‚Äôm autistic and have ADHD so i already struggle with emotional disregulation, which has only gotten worse as school and life and funerals have started piling up on me. \n\ni truly don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, so please if you have advice on how to cope with anger whether it be for my partner to be less angry or for me to handle it all better  when he is i would be endlessly appreciative for your thoughts.\n\nTLDR; my partner is angry all the time and mean when he‚Äôs angry, how do i help him manage his anger or how can i  cope better with it when he is angry??"

I (22M) am desperately in love with a close friend of mine (22F) and I am quite sure that this feeling isn't mutual (I tried giving her hints but she just assumed I was being friendly). Since I know/assume this, I don't wanna open up to her because I don't wanna lose a close friend while trying to be something more. That would scar me greatly. But I am also aware that this cannot go on like this anymore. Anytime she mentions a date she went on or a crush she has, I die inside, and all I do is pretend I don't and be a good friend. I cried a couple of times because of this. Every song/book/movie about love reminds me of her. To those who will advise me to open up to her: If I had felt any glimmer of mutual feelings, I would have. I also know that this has happened to her before (a friend falling in love with her), and their friendship slowly faded away. I don't want that to happen to me.\n\nSo I am asking for advice that could get me out of this mental hell I've put myself in. I apologize if there were some unnecessary details but this is the first time I am sharing this with other people and I needed to get some things off my chest.

                "body": "I need your help, Reddit. I am a 34 year old man. I have been a store manager at a seasonal place the past couple of years and I had an employee last year (I'll call her Sally) that would say things in passing that caused me to become more and more concerned about her family life. Concerned enough to leave an impact. However, she was 17 at the time and I didn't know how to approach the situation and kept telling myself it was none of my business, so I just kind of coasted through it until the season ended and that was that.\n\nWell, I returned again this year and so did she. At first it seemed like things might have been getting better for her, but then I started noticing those red flags popping up again. She started to be more open with me as the season went on and once it ended she wanted to stay in contact. We have talked a lot now and, needless to say, I am very concerned for her. Her father is absent and she lives with her mother in a one bedroom apartment where she attends school online and basically never leaves. Honestly, I would have been surprised her mom allowed her to go out and get a job except that I know they aren't super financially stable and she needed the extra money. Sally suffers from anxiety and depression and her hyper-religious mother believes that only god and jesus can make those things go away. By some miracle her mom lets her go to a therapist and get medication, so there is that one good thing, but she has told me multiple times that her mother doesn't like that she actually takes the meds and tries to get her not to, so much that Sally often has to sneak them if she doesn't want her mom giving her shit about it. Her mom is very manipulative and constantly gaslights her and blames her for having mental health issues. She guilts Sally for the medical bills she's had to pay for her. She doesn't let Sally have any hobbies or even watch movies or TV and has made her throw away a majority of her 'non-essential' possessions on multiple occasions, including again today. And the list goes on.\n\nIt's killing me to just sit here and watch while all of this is happening to her, so this is where I need advice. Is there even anything I can do? Sally is 18 now, so legally she could leave her mother at any point, but I don't know how that would be possible. She still has one last semester of school, but I don't know how it works online. I don't know if her mom pays for it or if leaving her household would have any effect on if she could continue to attend. She also doesn't have any other family she has contact with, so I don't know where she would go. I know she wants to be out, but I also think the uncertainty could scare her so much she might not have the strength to leave. Or she will think she deserves to be in this situation. Her mom is also becoming suspicious of our friendship, which, between a 34 year old man and an 18 year old girl I obviously completely understand, but it's making it harder for me to have the opportunity to even approach this subject with Sally. I honestly don't think she knows she can legally leave now. She told me at the end of the season that she wanted to keep in touch with me because I'm the only person who has ever showed her kindness and it fucking breaks my heart. I just want to know if there's anything at all I can do to help her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; I (34M) have an ex-employee (18F) in a bad situation at home and want to know if there's anything I can do to help get her out of it."

They are NOT paying for the trip so I think them being annoyed by it is a bit unfair. I passed my classes and I have a part time job while in school (I'm taking a break from working during the holiday break because I need to prepare for my trip and I am taking this opportunity to apply to as many jobs as I can for graduation. The job pays minimum wage but it's an on campus job at a labratory).  \n\nMy parents pay for my tuition on the agreement I do not fail (I have not, I was on Dean's List too as a freshman). I never ask them for money, and I even spend my own money helping out with my little brother sometimes.  \n\nI made a few mistakes that being during finals an internship for SPRING semester I wanted replied to me and I got the email late because I got it during finals and I wasnt checking my email diligently enough. I own up to that, my bad, but I am still applying for things diligently so I have a job for after graduation. I have applied to like 20 jobs in the last 3 days on winter break. Mom also OFFERED to sent my resume to her boss because her boss has connections to the chemical engineering industry. I also made a communication mistake at my job which my father heard about because he works at the university I attened, which he was annoyed by but I have rectified too. This past semester has been a hard one clearly.  \n\nAnyway, my family is very annoyed by this international trip I am taking even though, once again they are paying nothing to it. I understand they are worried, but I don't think they have a right to be mad. Father also said I \"can't rely on them to get me a job\" when I never said I would, I simply took the help from them they offered me. They won't stop me from going on this trip, but they dissaprove heavily. They say I have to be \"more of an adult\" but I already about to graduate in may in a degree that is rigorous with high earning potential, plus working part time on top of that. Them paying for my tuition is something THEY offered and I have held up my end of the bargain. I also plan on taking the FE exam this semester because it will be good for my resume. My question is, what else am I missing to be more \"adult\" in their eyes? Because I am sure as shit trying my best. It just feels like all the gifts they give me they can hold against me when I do something I dissaprove of. It's not like I can move out tomorrow so I'm not sure what these people want from me. Do I get ANOTHER part time job while already doing a rigorous degree? Feedback would be great."

I've recently started a relationship with someone who has bipolar disorder: she's an amazing person, beautiful, passionate, caring, generous, sensitive, compassionate, loving and we have by far the best chemistry I've ever had in my life. \n\nThe only issue is that I'm new to the condition and the experience of dealing with it. I know I love her and she loves me and I want to be there for her no matter what. Thing is, at times she will say awful things to me, horrible things that are designed to hurt, and her personality will change from those traits aforementioned to someone very cold, calculating and sadistic. I've even asked her if she just wants to hurt me and she has said yes, but she doesn't know why. Now, she has had trauma in her life before: abusive exes and even worse (which I will not go into here). Regardless, I just want to be there for her. I can take the hurtful comments, I am strong and have also been fucked with on many occasions. \n\nWhat I can't take is her threatening to leave. I know she doesn't mean it (always), but it hurts so much. I have self harmed in the past in moments of great distress but now I find myself doing it more and more as a way to deal with the horrible pain. I'm a very affectionate person who craves physical contact (not sexual, just physical), and one of her go-to things to do when she's upset with me is to not allow me to touch her at all. It hurts so much because she's normally so welcoming of my affection, I panic and I feel lost and powerless and I don't know what to do. This inevitably results in a spiral of self-pity and she hates that too. \n\nIt's the coldness that really bothers me though. I can be sat there in floods of tears, apologizing ad nauseam for any transgressions I have made, and she seems completely calm yet somehow vengeful. Like she wants me to suffer, and to know why I should suffer. I've also done stupid and foolish things with her too, like threatening to slit my own throat if she leaves, which I know is toxic, stupid behaviour. I hate feeling that desperate. I just want her to be happy, and I want to be the one to make her happy. \n\nSo the question is this: how much should I attribute to her condition, what can I do to improve and what advice would you give? I'm totally new to all this but I know I want to be with her, warts and all. She's perfect for me in every single way and it feels so much like I'm the one messing things up, or acting in ways I don't normally act, nor want to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated."

I am unable to feel loved in general because i have never been loved by my family as a child and friends etc. So i am rather a ''close your feelings'' type of person and at some point it became too real that i can't really feel anything positive from people.\n\nSo i have been with my bf for like 5 monts and we were friends for a few years before that. It is LDR and we met online (we have met irl and it was mostly cute and nice). I basically hate myself so it is REALLY hard to believe he loves me. He mentioned before that i should at least try to believe him because it makes him sad. And i am trying but he makes it hard to do so. He is really sweet in daily life and he verbally expresses his love often, however, it feel like he just loves me verbally and when i am in a good mood. I am not really sure how to describe it tbh because i am mentally unstable( i have depression and anxiety) and i am confused about my own thoughts and feelings most of the time as i overthink everything. But he sometimes makes me question if i should even be with him. He never gets super excited about me and he never gets angry (or even a bit annoyed) about someone who makes me sad or hurts me. Little things like these bother me. The other time he asked me if i would be sad if I didn't get anything on my bday from him, which really broke my heart. I never cared about my bdays but i NEVER got any present on my bday before so i was thinking it would be kinda cute to get something my someone who ''loves'' me. And he didn't really do anything for me before so i was hoping it would be an excuse for him to do something but looks like nope. I cried the whole night after that question and i said ''no i wouldnt be sad'' which was obviously a lie (coz of my voice) and he understood it and asked me if it made me sad later the night but we didnt talk about it again.\n\nOther than that he usually doesnt do anything to cheer me up when i feel sad. I know i am a hard person and it is not his ''job'' to deal with my mental problems (honestly i thought it kinda was untill i read some reddit post that people were really mean about these kind of things)\n\nI don't kow what to do, i don't really want to break up because i have already became attracted to him but it would be easier to be alone if it will hurt like this at even the simple things\n\nAlso i am not sure if i am being overly sensitive or that is normal to be upset honestly"

Since we were locked inside our houses we practically spent our entire days on zoom and the connection kept growing deeper. Things went on pretty well for 8months and then suddenly all the small issues started to get to me (I was also dealing with depression at the time)and after a month of dealing with those thoughts I decided to end the relationship but he was hell bent on trying to make this work.

                "body": "TLDR: My long-time best friend admitted she's always loved me. I'm not sure if I want to risk damaging our friendship and I'm unsure how to proceed. \n\nHey there. First post here, but I need some help. So background. I've been friends with this woman since middle school. We've always been really close and have gotten along wonderfully. I love her to death. We've had times where we didn't talk a whole lot due to relationships, but we always found the time to at least check up on each other every now and then. Back in our younger days, I asked her out on many occasions always to be shot down. It hurt, but I still loved her as a friend and didn't want to lose her, so eventually I just gave up on the idea of dating her and have been perfectly content just being besties. She knows everything about me, and I her. We're always there for each other.\n\nWell I got divorced a few years back and she's been single for a while now as well so we've been hanging out pretty regularly as of late and it's been great! Our hangouts usually consist of getting stoned, watching movies, and cuddling together. I take her out to dinner pretty often as well because we both love food lol. Being around her is just so easy and comfortable and fun. \n\nAbout a week ago, she was my plus one to a big event. Said event had an open bar. I'm not a big drinker, but she likes to party so I told her beforehand to just have fun and I'll be the DD and take care of her if she decided to get trashed. Well trashed she did indeed get. Enough so that while we're standing outside talking to some friends, she goes off on a tangent about how all men are shit, and then directs it towards me and starts telling me that I'm a piece of shit among other things. My friends are just standing there awkwardly as I'm asking her where the hell this is coming from because not once has she ever said such horrible things to me before. It caught me completely off guard. I guess she realized what she was saying and sat on the ground and started to cry. Eventually she calmed down and we left the party early. \n\nSo we're heading home and she's still sobbing and upset. We're both silent otherwise. Then she blurts it out. \"I've always loved you. I'm sorry, I didn't want you to find out like this but I love you.\" WUT. After years of being friends, her making it abundantly clear that she wanted nothing more from me than friendship, and now she tells me she loves me this whole time. I was dumbfounded. I just stayed quiet and let her talk. She said she never felt like she was enough for me. Like she could never live up to my expectations of a partner. She'd understand if I hated her and never wanted to see or speak to her again. My mind was racing.\n\nI hadn't said much the whole ride home so when we were pulling up to her place she told me just to drop her off in front of her apartment complex and she'd walk the rest of the way. She was wasted and I wasn't about to do that so I finally spoke up and told her \"stop. I don't hate you. I love you. I just have a lot to think about. But I'm not gonna leave you alone after all this. Let's just go inside and cuddle and talk about this.\" So we did, as much as we could with her being drunk, and eventually we were both in a better mood. At one point she was laying with her head on my chest and I asked if I could kiss her, she said yes, and we did. It was great. \n\nWell since then we hadn't talked too much about it all aside from her apologizing the following day and me telling her it was okay and I just had a lot to think about. So now we arrive at my dilemma. I obviously love this woman. But do I love her as my friend, or more? I've thought about her as my friend for so long, I'm really not sure. And I'd hate to try a relationship, have it not work, and it sours our friendship. I don't want to lose her. Also (this may be shallow and I'm sorry but it's just a preference I can't control) she has gained quite a bit of weight over the last couple years. She's still beautiful, don't get me wrong. She will always be beautiful. But I'm just not sure if I'm sexually attracted to her. I want to be. I just don't know if that's something that would get better with time or not. The weight gain also may be due to a medical issue for which she is currently awaiting tests to discern, so it could change as well. But regardless, is this something I should bring up VERY gently when discussing our future together? I don't feel like it's something I should hide, but I also don't want to hurt her. I don't know. \n\nAside from those hangups, she would make a great partner. She LOVES my kids and they love her. We like a lot of the same movies and music, our religious and political views are identical, we have the same love language, etc. I'm just not sure what my next step should be. I never, in a million years, thought I'd be in this situation but here I am. And I'm so confused and unsure. What do you wonderful people think? Should I throw caution to the wind and go for it considering our history would indicate we'd probably be a great couple, or should I just stay friends and not chance possible destruction? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

So it wasn‚Äôt a big problem but sometimes when I do something wrong with her or make some jokes she starts to complaining but when those friends do the same thing she say nothing. So at this moment I knew she starts to abandon me.  \nBut she definitely leave me at around November, for no reason she starts to ignoring, not talking to me and she had fun with her ‚Äúnew friends‚Äù while I was abandoned by her.

So, I went to the cafetaria, I saw her and I said ‚Äúhi‚Äù, but she didnt answered me and she even turn herself to not see me.

                "body": "I'll try to be as clear as possible. English is not my first language so bear with me. I don't even know if this is the proper place to write this. It is my first time posting.  \n\n\nI (m43) have been living abroad from the past 17 years. I came to live here on my own, so I have no family and I had to make new friends, which of course I have. One of them is my friend , let's call him John  (m45). I absolutely love him. We have been friends for 10 years more or less and we have become very important for each other. I have been with him through important and difficult parts of his life and he has been my rock when I've been in need, especially emotional support.  \nWe have a very special relationship: we have been sexually intimate in the past, it happened several times and I loved it. We both always took it as some sort of bonding thing between us, but we have never been romantically interested in each other. Our friendship has been probably more satisfying than a romantic relationship. Even if we haven't been  sexually intimate for a while, we use to kiss on the lips when we greet each other (i do that also with other friends as well).  \nJohn has been on a relationship with a guy for the past year and a half, I think, let's call him Peter (m36). He  moved in recently  with John, from another city, so he is in the process of making new friends and stuff like that, Peter is a great guy, and also sexy. Slowly we started to get to know each other, hanging out all together. For me it was  important to be accepted by Peter, considering how important John is to me. I was happy to see that Peter was opening up with me. He soon was included on the list of friends I kiss when I greet them, let's put it this way.   \nOne day the three of us plus a common friend got really, really wasted... so we all ended up being, let's say, a lot friendlier with each other. It was super fun and cool, not proper full-package sex but sexual nonetheless. It was nothing new between me and John but for sure it was a new situation with Peter and I realised that he was like, very much into it with me. It felt good because I didn't know he would be like that with me. Of course we were very drunk, but I thought it was so nice that it happened, like we bonded more. A nice memory we created together. Me and John talked about it and he said he was happy to see that me and Peter were enjoying ourselves.  \nAfter that day of course we felt more comfy with other. It happened a couple of times to hang out again , all of us, chilling on the couch watching a film and hugging, being touchy and stuff, just like I usually do with John. I must confess that I do feel attracted to Peter, but after all, I do feel attracted to John as well, since ever, and we have carried on our friendship without a problem. I mean, there are a lot of people I feel attracted to in one way or another.   \nA week ago John was out of town and Peter asked me if we could have dinner together because he didn't want to be alone, and I agreed. We had food, a couple of beers, talked a lot about many things, having a great time. We were close to my place and wanted to go up to smoke some weed. We did and we started watching TV on the couch, his head lying on my chest, my arm around his torso. Sometimes holding hands, caressing , nothing really compromising, at least in my head, but I could feel my heart beating faster and faster.  \nThe thing is that caressing intensified a bit more. We even kissed a couple of times, and hands were going places, still somehow innocent... then not that innocent anymore. At the beginning I felt ok with it but then I thought that maybe we were crossing some lines... just because John wasn't present. It was nothing that hasn't happened before between me and Peter but... John was there as well, unlike this time. I'm sure Peter was going at it so I kind of freaked out but I kept it cool. I asked him \"what about John?\" \"What about him?\" he said, so I said: \"Well, I'm very happy to do whatever with you because I'm enjoying myself a lot, but I need to be sure that John is ok with it \" (John knew we were together that night, and  maybe he was ok with something happening between us, but I just didn't know!). Peter looked at me and said: \"yeah, maybe it is better if I go home. I need to wake up early tomorrow... but you know, everything is cool\". So we hugged and he left.  \nI freaked out because I thought \"OMG Peter was about to cheat on John with me so I was about to betray my beloved friend, was I?!\". I didn't know if Peter was going to tell John, if John was going to be mad about it, or maybe not. I was panicking! I cannot lose my friend.  At the same time I didn't want that my bond with Peter would go sour or become awkward because of this. I talked casually with John two days after and he was normal with me , and messaged with Peter and he was normal as well.  \nThe thing is... damn, I really want this. It made me feel so good! It made me feel accepted, wanted (yeah, Low self-steem issues here) and it was just beautiful to make such connection. I just wish that John would be ok with these situations, or he would be part of it if he wants to (that would be even better!). I just don't know how to ask if he is ok about it because it would mean to tell him what was going on that night between me and Peter. I don't want to put Peter in trouble and I don't want him to be angry at me... and even if me and Peter would never be in a situation like this again... should I tell John about it anyway?  \n\n\nI don't know how to behave. I'm glad that I was able to stop myself right before certain limit was about to be crossed. As you can see, I have a very \"free\" approach to sex and human relationships. I do think that sex is a great way to connect with people and sex among friends is great, on my book. This time, tho, I feel like I'm getting in trouble!\n\nAny insight would be appreciated.   \n\n\nTL;DR: I was about betray my best friend when his bf was about to cheat on him with me."

I grew out of that phase a few years ago and I can see she is trying, but Lucy still puts so much of her self worth into what others, especially guys, think of her. \n\n\nShe has been trying online dating. She has extreme standards. She finally met a guy she likes and he seemed to like her too. However, he is busy with school and moving and family life and everything else and does not have enough time for her. She wants to see him more than twice a week. I could tell from the start that she was getting attached really quick and that it was not going to end well but I wanted her to be happy. \n\n\nI am not good with emotional talks so I need advice on what I could possibly say to her! They talked - they were not dating - for three months. They texted everyday and this is the first guy she let touch her below the belt. He is also the first guy who was not lying when he said he did not care about sex and waiting. She told me she is heartbroken. I want to be there for her but I just don't understand what she is going through. I don't get attached to people that quick and don't want to tell her she is overreacting or whatnot. Lucy and I get along and love each other even though we are complete opposites when it comes to wants in a relationship. I guess you could compare us to Enid and Wednesday - from what she has told me LOL.\n\n\nI am taking her out to dinner tonight and making her a little gift basket, but I have no idea what to say to her. I know I can get by with saying she is hot and there are plenty of guys who would pay to meet her but she wouldn't believe me. I am known for being blunt and I am trying to not be. What would you want to hear if you were Lucy? \n\n\nAlso, please be kind! I know this can seem somewhat childish, but it is important to me to be there for my friend. I know I might sound like an asshole for my thoughts but I am just trying to convey how I obviously need help!"

                "body": " TLDR at the end\n\nSo I (27m) have a really good friend (also 27m), let's call him Frank (fake name). He is married (wife - Emma, also fake name) for something like 2 years now. A bit over half a year ago he confessed to me that his wife told him this marriage doesn't seem to work. That's all I got, there was no specifics. He was still in love and wanted my advice on the situation. Some more background (relevant later) Franks family lives in a different country, and Emmas live in the same city. He is like a brother to me, and I'm the closest friend he has, I was also the best man at their wedding.\n\nI'm notoriously bad with relationships of all kinds (I'm some type of neurodivergent person, my therapist was somehow very against testing, so I don't know exactly), but I advised him to go to couples therapy and communicate with Emma. Of course I let him cry on my shoulder, but again didn't get any details.\n\nI didn't hear about this again (to be fair we live far away, and rarely talk) so I assumed it's ok, or at least getting better. Then I visited them in their new house (they bought a house together while knowing they have trouble in their marriage, I try really hard not to judge), and it was actually the opposite of better. They tried to keep things... civil, but even I could feel the tension and notice that they tend to avoid each other.\n\nAnd now I've heard that Emma confessed to cheating on Frank. I didn't hear it from him, but I have a very credible source, so you can assume it's true. As a side-note, Emma's lover is married with kids. Seriously, trying really hard not to judge and focus on the problem at hand.\n\nNow here is the worst part. He is still in love with her. He will still do anything for her, it's driving me crazy. And what is she asking from him? To ignore (or at least pretend) the cheating and go with her to her parents for Christmas, so her parents don't suspect anything is wrong. Now Franks mother asked him to ignore Emma and instead go alone to her for the holidays. He refused, and wants to do what Emma asked him to do. Now I get that he doesn't want to fly oversees, it would be extremely difficult and expensive on such short notice before the holidays. So my mother (who also treats him like family) suggested he go to us for holidays, I love the idea. But again, I suspect he won't agree. Also my mother is not even supposed to know there is trouble in the marriage.\n\nSo the advice I'm asking for is how to convince him to join me on Christmas? And what (and how) to suggest to him for the next steps. I'm super mad at Emma for what she's done, and I would totally suggest divorcing her. But it's going to be messy, they have a loan on a house AND a car together. I'm completely unprepared to deal with such situation, I'll appreciate all advice you can give me.\n\nTL;DR: My friend got cheated on by his wife, but still loves her and does what she wants. I want him to spend holidays with me instead of her parents (on her request), and I need advice on how can I help him in this situation."

                "body": "I'm currently laying down on my (20f) bf's (21m) family home couch typing this on a phone. Beside me is him, his sister and mother - sleeping on the ground. I'll try to make this as short as possible haha.\n\nFor context, my bf and I are 3rd year college students and have been living together since last year - dating since high school (4 years).\n\nEarlier this week, his family (mom, brother, and sister) had planned to meet us to celebrate his bday. They offered to let the two us stay overnight in their home - which meant the 4 of us (mom, sister, me and bf) squeezing together on their small living room (brother has his own room).\n\nWe have done this before, once - and I didn't really like it. I don't like spending the night in anyone's house or even hotels, period - it makes me extremely anxious and uncomfortable, and I don't sleep very well either. I wake up about every hour and struggle to go back to bed. Which is why I choose to sleep at my designated home if I can, and he knows this.\n\nHe immediately accepted their offer and I didn't really have the heart at the time to say no, but I didn't say yes either. After a day, his mom said that it was okay if we didn't spend the night, and my bf said \"oh, okay\" and settled on not spending the night. This made me extremely happy and we agreed that we would go home and not spend the night.\n\nA few days later, while having a convo with my mom, I mentioned that we would not be spending the night after all at bfs family home. Bf immediately interjected and said \"well, we're not really sure\" - I gave him a pointed albeit confused look at the comment and he didn't say anything.\n\nI told him later on that if he wanted to spend the night, we should bring clothes or at least prepare since I had stuff that I needed to bring (my bc pills, much needed skincare stuff and etc). HOWEVER, I said this before I learned that I had to work ALL DAY after his bday. It would be best if I worked on his bday, in terms of my schedule and deadline BUT of course, I would never do that and bf comes first and I can work it out anyways. He knows I have to work and he knows the deadline is very soon.\n\nSo, today came, we didn't bring any stuff with us, he didn't tell his mom we would be staying overnight. Our last convo about it was me saying that if he wanted to stay, he should tell me so we can bring our stuff. Lo and behold, night fell and his mom asked \"are you staying?\" And he answers happily \"yes!\"\n\nI was surprised and didn't have the guts to say no, I have been trying to be liked by his mom for ages after she hated me during hs lol. We now have a great relationship and I DID NOT WANT TO RUIN IT.\n\nI got upset at him but kept it all good with his family. He asks if I'm okay, I tell him no I'm not. I have no clothes, I don't have my fucking pills, or my stupid cleanser and yes I'm just very very upset.\n\nHe tells me it's okay, they'll lend me clothes, they have skincare stuff and I can miss the pill - we just won't have sex for 7 days according to my pills' instruction and it's okay, we haven't had sex in a month anyways lol. Even after I kept initiating after he complained that \"I didn't seem into it sometimes\" - but that's a whole other world and not the point of this post.\n\nNow it's almost 4 am, after he tried coaxing me by watching anime with me, he's now asleep and I'm still wide awake. I woke up at 7:30 am the day before and have to work in a couple of hours. Fuck me, I'm so mad.\n\nHe's done and said other things that greatly concerned me without my permission before this too. Sometimes I feel like he doesn't respect me anymore or he isn't interested in me anymore. Maybe it's time to move on I don't know. I just want to be home with my dog rn (someone's looking after her no worries).\n\nThese 4 years have not been flawless of course but I do love him and I think he's been great otherwise. I just feel like recently, much more than before - he doesn't care about my input and doesn't listen to me (sometimes I think he finds me annoying). We've had issues before but they weren't this bad. I've talked to him about this, time and time again but I'm growing tired.\n\nShould I try talking it out with him or just leave? I'm very conflicted.\n\nTL DR: Bf made us stay in his family's house after agreeing we wouldn't because I have to work the next day and made me miss my bc pill, he's done this before and I feel disrespected and worthless to him. I think I should break up with him."

                "body": "Me (M29) and my partner (F29) have been together since we were 24, five years.\n\nThe beginning of the relationship was not ideal. I was at a point of extremely high confidence and she was at a point of very low confidence. I had recently come from a string of hookups that had me feeling like hot shit. We began hooking up and it almost felt as if I ‚Äòfell into‚Äô the relationship. At that time she was extremely quiet. We had incredible physical chemistry but I don‚Äôt think I had the proper feelings of ‚Äòbutterflies.‚Äô I never thought to myself ‚Äòoh my god im so lucky‚Äô to be with this person. \n\nI‚Äôm a very social and artsy person and she is more introverted and enjoys the arts but not to the same degree as me. \n\nOvertime I fell in love with her but this feeling of unease or uncertainty would pop up from time to time. Sometimes I would find myself googling ‚Äòhow do I make myself love someone more‚Äô or ‚Äòuncertainty in relationships.‚Äô  I never really thought too seriously about breaking up but I was have fleeting thoughts about it or fleeting fantasies about being single again. \n\nThe relationship got better and better. We moved in together and have been living together for 2.5 years. We have a lot of fun in our relationship and we‚Äôre constantly laughing. No one thinks I‚Äôm funnier than she does lol. I know that she loves me incredibly deeply. When I look up checklists of what a relationship needs to move forward with marriage we check every box. \n\nBut these feelings of uncertainty began to bubble up in the past month in a more serious way. They began to make me feel sick. Like I was keeping a big secret from the person I love the most. \n\nI was doing a lot of reading online about how you should feel about moving into marriage with your partner and I read something that said moving into marriage you should feel ‚Äòfuck yeah‚Äô and not ‚Äòyeah.‚Äô and I only felt ‚Äòyeah‚Äô\n\n\nSo we had a conversation and I told her about my ongoing uncertainty and how I feel ‚Äòyeah‚Äô but not ‚Äòfuck yeah‚Äô about our future. This conversation was supposed to be about us working on our relationship but it ended with her proposing the question that we break up and I didn‚Äôt fight it. In that moment I felt that if we didn‚Äôt break up then I would end up breaking up with her later.\n\nI spent two days discussing it with my friend who thought I made the right choice. I discussed all the problems. I was extremely sad. Other people I talked to about it were less certain about my decision. As I voiced all my concerns about the relationship the problems began to feel trivial. I recognized that no one is perfect and all these small things don‚Äôt matter much. There were these small things that could have been conversations. \n\nSo I started to reframe my thoughts to think about how it could work if we move forward together. The sadness disappeared and was replaced by knots in my stomach. The same feelings I had that led to me having this conversation in the first place. \n\nI‚Äôm afraid that maybe I don‚Äôt love her enough? Even though everything mostly seems good on paper there is this ineffable uncertainity I can‚Äôt shake. I‚Äôm afraid that this uncertainty might be coming from this unrealistic adolescent fantasy of what my life was ‚Äòsupposed‚Äô to be like. I‚Äôm also facing a lot of uncertainity in the other aspects of my life right now. Some of my closest friends have begun to really piss me off. And the career I‚Äôve been working towards seems like it might not happen. Perhaps these other uncertainities I‚Äôm just taking out on her?\n\nIt comes down to the fact that when I think about cotinuing with her I have crazy stomach pain. Like my body is telling me it isn‚Äôt right. But we didn‚Äôt get this far for no reason. The day to day is really good. I‚Äôm afraid that if we get back together I‚Äôll still feel this way after working on our problems and break her heart again. \n\nI‚Äôm just deeply confused. If you read all this thank you."

Since I'm not really sure how to feel about them, and I don't want to waste any more time on them if they don't want to even try, and I'm sure they'd feel the same, but I also want to know if they actually do want to try talking more, but just haven't really been able to for one reason or another \n\nLike I don't know, at this point I feel like they don't, but I still want to give them one last chance, plus neither of us have any real friends right now either, so I'm not sure why they'd be fully against it, but that seems to kind of be the case\n\nSo I'm not sure, there is also the fact that both of us are also very shy and awkward people, but even then I don't think that's an excuse for them to give a vague no every time I asked to do something, so I want to ask something they can't just find a way out of and I want to know what they actually think instead of them just trying to make a way out\n\nIt's frustrating too, because we'd talked about stuff like that so many times before, like they literally know that my biggest problem and fear is people lying to me about what they actually think so it's hard to believe that they'd to that, but honestly it seems to be what's happening, so I just want to make sure so I can move on in one way or another\n\nTLDR: I want to give up on someone who I've realized doesn't really seem to care about me, but I want to make sure before leaving, how should I do that?"

For as long as I know my SO, he has been an incredibly optimistic and genuinely happy guy. Sure he would have some ups and downs, but I really mean it when I say that he has always been happy. This is a guy who can find the silver lining in anything, pure sunshine, extremely extroverted. \n\nIn our relationship, I've always been the slightly more mentally unstable one. When we first started going out, I was deep in the depression and this guy pulled me out far enough to let me get my feet on the ground. We were barely a few months into the relationship and he would go out of his way to help me do even the simplest tasks. \n\nWe always had a bit of a bumpy road ahead of us, queer couple, traditional parents, both of us immigrants. Tough but somehow we scraped by, got our shit together, figured life out. Throughout all I've never seen him fall so far down in terms of mental health. Not when our parents bickered between each other because of nationality and made both of our lives living hell for a year or so at the beginning. Not when our close friend passed away a year or so ago. \n\nA few weeks ago I started noticing a shift in him. He works from home, so he's taken it upon him to handle cooking. (Also probably because I've gotten both of us sick with food poisoning twice). But he also always seemed to truly enjoy it. He's almost stopped cooking fully, claiming he's not in the mood to do it. Which is fine by itself, I don't mind, the problem is so many of his usual habits he's dropped. \n\nHe doesn't go to the gym anymore (something I've never seen him skip), he doesn't go hang out with his friends, I haven't even seen him play video games which is something he's always really enjoyed. By the time I get home (albeit it's usually quite late, typically 7 or 8 pm), he's already in bed, more often sleeping. I don't even see him working on his pottery projects, which has always been his passion \n\nI'm really worried. I've tried doing the things he did for me when I was really bad mentally, helping him eat well, making sure he's taking care of his hygiene, keeping the apartment clean so that he's not spending his time in filth.  I've tried talking to him about maybe seeing a therapist but he claims he doesn't need it, that everything is fine and he's just tired. I don't know if he's trying to fool me, but when you know someone as well as we know each other you can tell when something is wrong. \n\nI've tried talking to his sister, trying to see if she maybe knew something that I didn't. But between the two of us, we couldn't figure out anything had happened. She's thinking that he might be using drugs again, which I'm not too sure on. I know if college he used to use a lot at parties and such, but as far as I know (and have been told) it was never addiction levels and I haven't really seen him take any drugs in recent memory. \n\nHis birthday is coming up, and this morning he told me he doesn't want to celebrate at all and to just treat it like a normal day. Again, all these things individually aren't alarming, it's all of them together added tot he fact that I know what he usually is makes me incredibly worried. \n\nThe irony is, I've been where he is, I should know how to help. But I'm lost. I'm not sure on how help at this point. He's completely shut down and shut me out.  I feel like all I can do is try to keep him physically healthy, but it doesn't feel like enough\n\n\nTLDR: I'm certain my SO is depressed but I don't know why, or what triggered this, or even how to really help him"

I should state that we have been together for almost 3 years and we live together. I noticed that nobody ever likes or comments on anything I tag him in so I checked and it was set to only him being able to see that or his relationship status. When we first started dating he went through my Facebook and deleted most of the men who showed any bit of interest in me even if it was years before we started dating and he made sure my relationship status was set to friends being able to see it. He is a good man and I love him so much but I feel gross and not good enough. If he isn't cheating, is he ashamed of me? I used to think of myself as an attractive person but now I feel insecure.

Three months into our relationship she told me she was asexual, but still enjoyed sex to some degree.  I have a fairly high libido and would prefer to have sex a couple time a week but she would be more content with once or twice a month.  We do have sex once a week plus she‚Äôll let me jerk myself off while eating her out in lieu of sex but it‚Äôs usually because I initiate and i just feel so gross because I can tell she‚Äôs only doing it for me and it just takes me out of my head and makes the act depressing.  I‚Äôve tried to come up with sex acts that don‚Äôt involve actual penetration such as her dominating me but she shoots me down and just doesn‚Äôt want to work with me to find some kind of solution.  She claims to enjoy sex and has on many occasions initiated it which is frustrating because of the unpredictability aspect.  I feel like my sexual side is just something she wants to sweep under the rug and not acknowledge.

                "body": " \n\nHi everyone, tldr;\n\nI'm 31 years old, single for about six months now and have been casually someone I met off of an app since late October. Things have generally going well, currently the woman I am seeing lives about 60 miles north of me in New York. Due to this, I haven't been able to see her as often as I'd like (I just went on my third date with her last night), however we remain in basically daily communication since I have met her. The first date was in early October, went very well, and she texted me how she had a great time and would like to get together again as I was driving home within the first hour after leaving her (I made sure to kiss her on the lips before departing). The second date, I took her to brunch, and then axe throwing, where we went drinking, threw axes and did other things. She also texted me that she had a great time within an hour after seeing her. Last night I saw her again, it was snowing, I took her to get sushi, and we went to a fun place that had live music, arcade games, bowling, axe throwing (I didnt try to throw axes again but it was her idea, and it's rural in upstate NY so its difficult to get a lot of fun plans in winter up there). I believe the date last night went well, she texted me after leaving again within the first hour, telling me she had a good time, and how she wasn't looking forward to me going on a long vacation (I am going to Miami for 2 weeks this Friday). Also to note, when I was departing with her, we made out in my car for 2 - 3 minutes, where she put her tongue into my mouth (I think this is a good sign). She also held hands with me, and we've playfully flirted with one another, she even laughs at my semi-corny jokes.\n\nPart of the reason I have not seen her as much is because she lives with her mom, however she bought an apartment in NYC and is moving in next month. I currently moved back in with my parents after ending a 5 year relationship, so living here for the winter and then moving into NYC in April to sign a new lease. She seems okay with this really, and hasn't really shown any signs of disinterest due to me living with my parents. However, she did indicate she doesn't really introduce guys to her family until she's been with them a while (fine, I get it, same way here with women).\n\nI know not to get all caught up on one woman, so I have still been on apps, going out, dating during the week. I have dated other women during the week, she has gone out during the week, less than me, I suspect maybe shes been on a few dates but dont know for sure, but absolutely know for sure and know better to NOT ask her, and to give her space. This girl texts me during the day every single day, and its rare I go an entire day without hearing from her. I make sure I don't respond immediately, sometimes a few hours can go by or an hour or two between responses. She initiates I would say maybe 60 - 70% of the contact, asks me questions, and generally there is not a day that goes by that I do not hear from her. I don't really have any concerns as things are going where they are, and I know not to get caught up on one girl, which is why I'm dating other women, however I really do like this girl.\n\nMy thinking as of this point is continue to take her out, show her a good time, have fun, hang out , hook up, rinse and repeat until she brings up the discussion of being \"exclusive.\" I find that men who do best are generally working on being the best version of themselves and everything else follows. Again, the only challenges at this point it appears are really have been she lives with her parents, I live with my parents, although we both work jobs making six figures, she is moving out next month (she has already said we can have dinners together in her new apartment and sleep over, cuddle and make out on couch, etc). Thankfully, I am moving out April 1st, so its not terrible. Also to my surprise, last week when she went out and got drunk with friends in the city, she told me I should be more aggressive with her in terms of just grabbing her and making out going forward, so I started doing that last night, although I was careful not to go too far as much as I wanted to start feeling her up in the car (Maybe ill venture into that territory next date?)\n\nHow does it sound like things are going overall? I'm assuming the fact she texted me last night again within an hour regardless of the topic after of me leaving, put her tongue in my mouth, still texting me today and reaching out to me, asking me questions, etc is a good sign? I would be exclusive with her but I will not ever bring this up, I am under the impression this may eventually come up from her after a few more months of hanging out, dating, having fun and hooking up, especially with her now closer to me in her new apartment, and then me moving out shortly thereafter. Does anyone have any feedback or guidance to give me overall? I find that women tend to like men the most, when you give them space, are not clingy, let them come to you (women cannot dump you if you can get to a position where they are the ones chasing you). I do not to mess it up with this girl, and truthfully, really like her. Does it sound like she likes me too? I am assuming if she liked me a lot she wouldn't be texting me so quickly after dates, among other things?\n\nHappy Holidays and thanks for your advice in advance!"

My boyfriend (19) thinks it is completely appropriate to follow his second and third cousins who post pictures that could be perceived as sexy or attractive. An example is a photo in a bikini, showcasing the background but turned away from the camera so you see their behind, or a picture of them wearing a silk red dress posing to show high thigh from the leg slit as well as just being generalized as a typical picture posted by girls wanting to be perceived in that way. Some other pics are body suit pics where they are pulling up their swimsuit to expose tattoos under the bikini line, again, a pose often perceived as sexual or attractive to people attracted to that. It makes me extremely uncomfortable and so I asked him to unfollow those cousins, not stop talking to them, but he says he doesn't see them sexually so it doesn't matter he liked that stuff. Many people I've asked say it is weird, and he says it's because I call the pictures sexy when I don't do that and I just show them the pictures. His family says it's normal as well as everyone he has supposedly asked, but I still can't be comfortable with it.\n\nI just need advice on if I'm being too much, or maybe there is something wrong with this picture. I've had past relationships also see no issue with this, including one person actually having a relationship with a cousin, but despite this he tells me it's just our different family environments and pretty much won't see why it bothers me.¬†\n\nI should also mention,  all the normal pics of them dressed and just face pics were never really liked, only posts like those‚Ä¶ It's several other friends accounts as well where he seems to like specifically only female friends who post similar pics and many times he'll claim he never liked the picture despite it being liked (one pic like this was an old friend who was shirtless and only had a flower covering her chest). I just want to feel respected, but despite asking him not to, he still continues to follow more girls like that based on the pretense of them being friends (most he hasn't spoken to in several years unless he reaches out but they never reach out to him first anymore) and having more female friends than males and liking pictures like that knowing my feelings on it. He only reaches out to girls as well, but none of them reach out to him first aside from one that I know is a close friend.

However, she's constantly living in his memory, either comparing stuff i do to what he used to do (whether good or bad), or randomly zoning out, remembering him.\n\nI had a rule in my life that i would never allow myself to be in such a position of comparison. I would never allow myself to be a substitute, a 2nd choice. But I broke this rule and I don't know what to do. On one hand, I love her unconditionally and i would gladly take not 1 but 10 bullets for her. On the other hand, she doesn't reciprocate the same kind of feelings.\n\nI don't even understand what it means. She says she loves me, but she loves him too. She loves him in a very special way, she says. But she loves me just like she loves her female friends. The only difference is that I'm a man, and she's sexually attracted to me. She also says we're the prettiest sexiest COUPLE she's ever seen.\n\nIt sounds like a fwb position, but the way she acts is even more confusing. What is this? I'm unable to understand, nor am i able to figure out who the hell am I to her.\n\nI feel like I'm being used to fill a void. I feel unworthy. I feel absolutely like dogshit.\n\nI should leave, but i cannot get myself to do it.\nI should tell her it's either me or him, but I'm afraid of the answer i know very well.\nI'm heartbroken. She is the most gorgeous thing to ever happen to me, and the most hideous thing to ever happen to me."

All I‚Äôve wanted throughout this whole time is to be back together we a family again and to try again. But my main issue is there is nothing between my wife and I at this point.

I can't remember what happened exactly but I know I stopped it and said that I was uncomfortable and didn't want anything to happen. The other person said sorry and that it wasn't my fault but I still feel guilty and I'm worried that I kissed her back as I know this is a deal-breaker for my girlfriend.\n\nI (m27)  have been with girlfriend(f28) for around 2 and half years and nothing has ever happened in our relationship that has caused a huge issue before  \n\nI went on a works night out last night. I got a taxi home with some of the people I'd been with and another of the passengers (F25?)started grabbing my hands and rubbing my leg in the taxi. I realised I wasn't comfortable and moved my hands so the other person could see thinking this would stop. \n\nWhen it was only us two in the taxi I told her that I felt very awkward and weird about it. She then grabbed my hand again and leaned on my shoulder. I went to move and as I did I put my arm on her back and she looked up and kissed me, as far as im aware I pulled back and looked at her very confusingly, I then leaned forward and she was still holding my hand and I said \"what was that\" or something similar and she went to kiss me again, I don't remember kissing her back but I'm terrified that I did, after I said it made me feel really weird and it's not something I want to do.\n\nThe girl then said how she was hoping I'd have stayed for some more drinks with her in the place she was getting out and I said I would never do that and don't want to. I left and she messaged me sorry and I said the same, a later message said that it was not my fault what happened. I'd mentioned taking her for her car the next day as she drove me and some others to the works event and being awkward I said I would still take her if she needs it, hoping to ask her what happened and why she did it even though she knows I have a girlfriend. \n\nI realised that I shouldn't do that and hoped for her to message so I could reply and say it's not a good idea, but she didn't need the lift in the end. \n\nI waited till my girlfriendbfinished work to tell her the next day as I thought i should I do it face to face and tell her what happened. She's obviously very upset that I got into the situation but I started to panic and couldn't remember if I kissed the other girl back, which I know would be a deal breaker.\n\nAs far as I was aware I never gave any signals, I did told her I was uncomfortable and then still everything happened. I'm scared of losing my girlfriend as I'd love a future with her but know this would ruin everything as she could never trust me if I kissed her back. I'm scared that I did and that the consequences are obviously something I do not want to happen. I am not in a good place right now with my girlfriend as we are arguing over our future plans but I know I just want mine to be with her. \n\nWhat's the best way to go about this? Do I wait and see? Message the other person to ask clearly what happened? I would really like other people opinions please."

Not sure how to cope with it or if I can stay since they have not been able to emotionally support me during my own grieving as I have done for them.\n\nTogether going on 15 years. When I met my partner their mother, who I loved dearly, was sick with cancer. 6 years into our relationship she died. So almost 9 years ago. I‚Äôve never expected that my partner will ‚Äúget over it‚Äù and accept that grief is an ongoing and sometimes lifelong process.\n\nWe have a sort of fairytale romance, teenage love, eloped a year in, and many people think of us as ‚Äúcouple goals‚Äù‚Ä¶ but everyone doesn‚Äôt know everything and I won‚Äôt get all the way into our relationship history here. It hasn‚Äôt been all roses and rainbows, but we have a solid foundation of love.\n\nLast year, 2 people in my family died, one by s‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢e, one by old age. I had a complicated relationship with my grandmother and lots of childhood trauma that was coming up. While I was grieving, my partner was not able to show up for me emotionally. I felt abandoned, though they tried their best, they were consumed with the grief of their mother and shifted the focus of conversations to processing that pain. It left me completely shell shocked to feel like all these years I have been their emotional support during their grief, but when I needed the same in return, I did not receive it.\n\nIt shattered the trust I had. We have talked about this and my partner has apologized for not being able to be there during my time of need. Fast forward to recently watching an episode of a show where the character‚Äôs grandmother died. At the end of the episode my partner started bawling and I instinctively held them while they cried. This lasted for a while, over 10 minutes. I know they were thinking of their mother. But it‚Äôs like they were completely oblivious to how I could be thinking of my grandmother who just died last year. Once again I felt like I needed to be the strong and supportive partner with no space to express the pain I was also feeling in that moment. When they are feeling their grief, it feels like it supersedes everything in our life.\n\nAlong with our other problems, it makes trusting for the future so difficult. When the next person dies in one of our families (likely their grandma) I feel like everything will revolve around them processing the pain and it is just a never ending cycle. I don‚Äôt know what to do about it and the thought of this makes me want to leave before anyone else dies. My partner is resistant to therapy and does not really talk to anyone else about the grief, so I feel like it‚Äôs on me.\n\nI would love to hear other people‚Äôs experiences if they have gone through similar or just reflections and advice.

                "body": "Basically what the title says. My (F25) husband(M26) broke up with me last night. We've been together for over 6 years, married only 5 months. He was my first everything basically. I still love him and I don't really know what to do now.\n\nWe were best friends in high school but didn't get together until college and have been pretty much inseparable ever since. When we first got together we were very immature and toxic (He used to be selfish sometimes and I have BPD, so I would lash out a lot) and probably should have broken it off then, but we both decided to stick with it and grow into a more mature, healthy relationship together. And I think we actually managed to do that. Sure, we occasionally fought but we always worked it out, kept open communication, and apologized while coming to a compromise. Our lives are heavily intertwined and we supported one another in our goals, pushing each other to be better.\n\nThe problems started up again a couple of weeks ago when he went on a work trip and came back. He sat me down and said that he wasn't happy with the way things were, as he felt like we were no longer our own people, more so we just became an extension of each other. It took me some time to see his point of view and I agreed, that maybe we needed space. Sunday mornings were then set apart for him to do his own thing (He works full time and I work part time while going to school full time so we heavily spent the weekend together since we didn't have much time during the week).\n\nI guess this agreement wasn't really working because two days ago after he came home from hanging out with coworkers he was laying next to me and told me that even though he loves me, he wasn't sure he was in love with me anymore. We decided he would take the next day to figure out what he wanted to do and when we talked again he said it wasn't fair to either of us to continue in this type of relationship (he had apparently been feeling this way for about two months), since he didn't want to keep stringing me along and he broke up with me. Before he did he suggested couple counseling but I wasn't sure if that would help since the problem seemed to be that he just wasn't feeling the same about me anymore. \n\nI would like to point out that we both have a history of mental illness, depression being the biggest, and I had assumed he was not only depressed, but under a lot of stress from work as he has a timeline over his head that will result in him either staying with the company or being fired. I am in my second to last semester in school and have been very stressed overall due to curriculum changes this semester. I asked him if there was someone else and he said no, which I believed as we are open about things like that and he doesn't seem like the type.\n\nWe live together but own no property and have no kids. We decided to continue living together until the lease is up (September 2023), as by that time I will have graduated and hopefully found a full time job. We live in the US, in a pretty pricey part of the country so this is the best financial decision for both of us. I asked him not to rush the divorce in hope that this will pass but I'm not sure it will.\n\nI don't really know why I'm writing this post. I guess I'd just like some advice on how to move on with my life. Thanks for reading, sorry it's so long."

Just tore me apart. That was march.\n\nIn Septemeber she messaged me and when I saw the Snapchat notification I couldn't believe my eyes. I never thought she'd message me again but after waiting a day to clear my head I opened it and it was a very genuine message asking how I was.\n\nMy instant thought in my head was to reply with \"you f\\*cking hurt me so much and made me so depressed.

We have been together for a little over a year, and in that time he has made some questionable decisions that leave me unable to trust him. I try. Our last violent fight, he smashed the window of my car to choke me, and that is the fight that gave me the leverage I needed with a visual aid that said that he needed to get sober. He's done relatively well since, and I am proud of him. I am 31, so when I became pregnant I was ecstatic, I didn't think I could have kids with some previous procedures I've had done.\n\nSo fast forward to now. My water broke 2 months early, I was on bed rest in the hospital for almost 2 weeks. My daughter was born 6 weeks premature and was in the ICN for 3 weeks. It was hell. Her father was never there. He never asked. He'd call me to fight or talk about how great things are going for him. He left me in the hospital twice after encouraging and instigating arguments that I am aware I shouldn't have participated in. I don't handle stress well, and it's all been stressful.\n\nHe is paying for our apartment although he's never here, and recently gave me a safe car for my daughter. Like I said, mine didn't have a window and I was his personal taxi for the last year and we ran my car into the ground. I appreciate what he's done for us although emotionally he is not available.\n\nI've tried to explain my stresses, while dealing with post partum. He says that I have borderline personality disorder and I have countless problems with myself, which might be true- but it's impossible to diagnose myself. We tried couples counseling but he says that our problems are \"too advanced\" and I need a psychologist, and insults whatever poor therapist gets stuck with us. Every day it seems like I have a new problem. And lately I am just angry and sick from it.\n\nI don't understand how someone can not acknowledge or ask about their child. I've been taking care of her by myself, so I'm awake 24 hours a day. This week she has been constipated and had colic, it's been a hard week. It breaks my heart that he doesn't ask about her, especially while she's so fussy and uncomfortable. He says that we are partners, and tells me that he loves me and hopes to see me soon, but he doesn't ask how she's doing.\n\nHe is volunteering with his other daughter's ski school, and spending a lot of time with her. He just got 50/50 custody of her recently and he's always asked about her and cared about seeing her. It really feels like when we decided to have a baby, he saw her as a back-up plan for if court failed. He did not visit my daughter in the ICN. When he left last week, he left without making sure we had formula- which we didn't. He's unable to argue, and I can feel my anger and resentment towards him growing every day, and though my daughter is small, I try to keep from badmouthing him around her.\n\nEvery day I talk to him, I give him opportunities to be a good father. I don't care about our relationship so much anymore, because I don't know how to keep loving a person that acts like this, I am not talking to him for me. Am I asking for too much by wanting him to just ask about her? Today I'm upset because he called to tell me that he loved me and said that he's skiing and it made me pop off. He knows that she's not feeling well but it's like she doesn't exist to him. I am overtired and I worry for my daughter's future heartbreak.\n\nEdit: I had a bad relationship with my father since childhood, so I'm feeling terribly guilty about burdening my daughter in the same ways that have damaged me. I'd hate for her to have an entirely absent father, and I'm not sure if it's worse to have a hurtful father or no father at all."

Then I just cry.\n\nWhen we first started dating, I told him this was an issue I had, and I don't know why I'm like that, but I don't want to be like this.

Five hour drive between our cities. He is my first boyfriend and only person I ever had sex with. I love him a lot.\n\nWe have a lot of similarities. Both of us only want serious relationships, we don't date people just for fun, have the same values in life and both want to have the same kind of life in the future. Both are very honest, have a good intuition about people we meet, are cold at first and then if we like someone we just go fully bunny mode. Funny enough even though we are different race people think we look alike. However we are both very emotional with mood swings, one day we can be confident and optimistic about the future but the next day extremely anxious and stressed ( In our defense we both are working on this particular personality trait). And most importantly neither of us knows what the hell we want to do in life in terms of a job. Right now I'm doing my masters and he is looking for a job. Since I met him he changed workplace 5 times, because of different reasons but mostly because he was trying to find a job he would like and he found one, but still he has days when he keeps asking me if this is the right job for him.\n\nI would say our communication is top notch, if there is a problem or an issue we discuss it and always try to understand each other. To be honest I understand him so well that usually he doesn't need to even tell me why he is upset or what's bothering him, because he is so similar to me that I just know. But I always ask him to tell me instead of assuming that I know everything about him.\n\nHe is the person I always wanted to find, someone who would love me for who I am, love me even when I'm not in a good mood. I didn't date for so long because I never felt that guys liked ME, not just the way I look, but he does. When I am with him I feel safe and I feel like I am home.\n\nHowever, I'm tired of being in a long distance relationship. My love language is touch and I have a much higher libido than him. Sex is good but not great, I really want us to improve but we can't, as we see each other once or twice a month. I already told him that being in a long distance relationship is hard for me and he always tells me that we can do it and in 2 years after I graduate we will be together. But doing the job he wants would mean that he will have to move every 3-6 months especially during the first 5 years. He already told me when he will propose and when he thinks we should have children. But all I can think about is how much I don't want to be in LDR for 5 years.\n\nThe biggest issue is that  both of us are high in neuroticism. I already told him that I was worried that because both of us are quite anxious people, it might be a problem. We had a conversation and in the end told each other that we should work on ourselves, be more emotionally stable and more dependable. However, time has passed and I'm exhausted by dating someone who is as prone to anxiety and pessimistic thoughts as me. Him assuring me that everything will work out, there is no need to worry about this and that and I should focus on the present that has no effect on me because in 2-3 days I will be the one giving the same speech. Now that he is not working, he of course is worried and anxious, even though I am not in a good place either, I force myself to smile and just try to not talk to him for a long time because adding his negative emotions with mine might drive me nuts....I feel so bad about this, because I know exactly how he feels and I'm his girlfriend....\n\nSo is this how real relationships are? What's the solution?"

The covid time was pretty hard as we were not able to see each other at all for a couple of months but hopefully, this time is behind us. \n\nThe long-distance factor makes us see each other regularly (roughly once a month) and for some short periods (from 4 to 15 days). We share the same educational background and general values. As my bf was used to living on his own, he made it clear that even when we were seeing each other he needed his personal space from time to time. I understood it, and we managed to find a good balance between us-time and self-time. My biggest concern is that I am not sure he is willing to build something with me. He is not super communicating by default, and it seems like he already has his solo routine that I am not sure I can fit into it. I also feel like I am way more invested in the relationship than him. I don't know what to do now. \n\nWe are supposed to move together this summer to the other side of the world to work in the same company and finally live together, but I am having second doubts about it (even though it is a bit too late, considering I didn't apply for some extension at my current work and I have already accepted the offer at the new job)."

                "body": "My fiance \" James\" and I have been together for 6 and a half years.  I told him when we first started dating that I was at the point of my life ( late twenties) where I knew that I wanted kids, and that wasn't going to change. James told me he also wanted kids- it was just a matter of how many he wanted. He also said he wanted to find somebody to be \" young family\" with.\n\nNow I have just turned 35 and James is about to turn 39. He proposed to me 3 years ago but he has basically walked back more and more of the steps he took post proposal regarding setting a wedding date.\n\nHe has gone from actively suggesting wedding planners and asking his brother in law to be his best man to firing the wedding planner behind my back and making plans for all the time that he is free during the spring and summers to be with his friends, or to go to one industry conference or another.\n\nI have tried to get him to come with me to therapy but one day when he didn't show up the therapist said to me \" therapy can help you talk through some things, but it cannot convince somebody to do or believe something that they are inherently opposed to for whatever reason. James is allowing you to view the trajectory of your relationship through a version of reality more beneficial to him than you, but is ultimately false to him. He now sees you as someone trying to make him conform to your \" false\" sense of reality and is punishing you for it.\"\n\nI was so upset after that session that I stopped going to therapy for a while, languishing in denial. I finally tried to bring it up and James actually flipped out and said he felt like he was the victim here. He said the therapist was partially right: I was trying to make his actions match up with MY worldview and it annoyed him to pieces. He says bottom line he did not want to begin to think about marriage or kids with me for at least another year.\n\nHe accused me of rushing things and stormed off. Afterwards he confessed that he needed to explore his options at least theoretically speaking. He dropped the bombshell that he didn't think I would be the ideal mother to his kids. And he believes in marriage before kids and for the purpose of kids so that explained the hold off on marriage.\n\nThe reason he cites for him not being sure about me is that he thinks our relationship initially went too fast. That we moved in together after a year and that his parents who are happily married continue to have an issue with that. However, the root of the problem is that when we started to get to know each other sexually speaking, he told me he wanted to explore more unconventional interests. One of it included him tying me up, putting his fist inside me, and also him urinating and defecating on me. He said his mind took a picture of those compromising situations and he cannot get over it. There was sometimes alcohol involved but we both agreed to do it and only with each other.\n\nHowever, he is now saying that it was horrible and that he doesn't trust my decisions, especially when alcohol and sleeping together are involved. That if he is looking at our kid or watching me give birth, that will be all he can think of.\n\nHe said he was sorry but cannot reframe his perception of me into a mother and hates me for it.\n\nSince we were airing everything, I told him I suspected he was cheating. He said he wasn't but admitted that his brother's wife had a younger sister who was a new graduate from college. He said people in his circle have been pressuring him, saying she was a nice, intelligent person who lived at home during college and didn't drink or do drugs. And that James could be brothers twice over with his brother. But he admitted that he found younger me way more attractive than her.\n\nAfter our talk I was devastated. He said he was going away for the week to think but after that week he asked if he could come back and tried to sleep with me again, getting upset when I refused.\n\nWhat do I do? Some corners of my social circle are saying that he's just confused and to fight for my 6 year relationship since we were so close to the altar. I really want a kids and family but I often see resentment in James' eyes when he looks at me. He never called off the engagement, saying he considers it still on."

I‚Äôm an art major and so I‚Äôve always had a good sense of how to pair things visually and what looks good on different body types. I also am usually pretty ‚Äúdressed up‚Äù and put together.\n\nI feel shallow but I just can‚Äôt get past it if he‚Äôs wearing something really goofy-looking, it kills my attraction.

What‚Äôs the best way to fix this? Will it be mean for me to get him some new clothes for xmas and start being more outspoken about his style? It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs *trying* to look good now or has a particular look he‚Äôs going for, so I feel like he‚Äôd be open to it.

My dad mostly chatted him up and my ceremony was surprisingly quick. Bf has met family and friends before, we have been dating for 7 months. \nHe brought me flowers and gifts. We all went to dinner afterwards and more family joined. Bf started to drink and anytime I made a playful joke to him he would super defensive and say something mean back often raising his voice, in front of my friends and family. My friends got clearly uncomfortable multiple times. At one point, one of my friends quietly asked him what he was getting me for Christmas, he responded and she repeated it quietly and he bit her head off and told her to shut up (this is her account). He also felt the need to correct me, and my friends in multiple instances. After dinner we all separated for a bit to go home and change before going out to bars. I texted him, asking him to be nice and to not drink anymore. He then was quiet the entire night, spoke to literally no one, and anytime i tried to include him or asked him what was wrong he would refuse to talk. Bf and I‚Äôs previous problems all revolve around this theme of lack of communication from him, as well as his overly sensitive and defensive attitudes. He will not communicate what he is feeling unless i push and push. When we arrived home after the fact he said he acted the way he did because he didn‚Äôt feel truly appreciated for being there (apparently he had to pay a coworker 50$ to take this shift which he didn‚Äôt tell me till after). I essentially told him that he should‚Äôve expressed this to me early on because then there was literally nothing i could do to help the way he was feeling. We talked more about his communication issues and he said he can find a therapist by the end of the weekend. He says he‚Äôs just an introverted better person who doesn‚Äôt know how to start good conversations with people. That he wants to be apart of my family and friends with my friends but doesn‚Äôt know how. I know that communication is a skill and a new group of people is intimidating but when i‚Äôve been in situations with his friends and family i would never act the way he did. I feel embarrassed and ashamed and I don‚Äôt know what else to do. \nTLDR: Bf has history of not communicating, defensiveness and over sensitivity. He embarrassed me on my graduation day and I don‚Äôt know what to do."

I really didn't plan  on settling for a situationship. The cherry on top is, boy came across  as dodgy af after 2 months and I wrote on different sub reddits, the  whole situation I was in, without bias. I asked advice from people. As a  whole 200 people told me to run away from this man and 20 people  suggested to stay and see where this goes. All my friends told me to cut  him off. You know what I did? exactly the opposite. I hung around  enough to find that the man had NPD and is a borderline psychopath.\n\nNo  worries, I broke off things w him two weeks ago and went no contact.  But what hurts me is my ignorance towards people's advice. I needn't  have gone through this trauma. I've started seeing a therapist but I'm  feeling extremely paranoid. I would say I gained a lot of experience and  lessons from this. I'm starting to learn more about narcissists and how  to dodge them. I've started working out and trying to take care and  love myself more, put myself first.\n\nI paid for all our dates (I didn't mind it, I didn't mind him being jobless cuz I know he was constantly looking for one).\n\nI visited him whenever he was feeling down. He never came to my place despite inviting him twice. Dodged it saying he was ill.\n\nI helped him in his job hunt, sacrificing my study time,\n\nHe  had a severe financial crisis. I was there, a girl he met 5 months ago  on a dating app, when no one was there for him. I paid his house rent,  fed his dog.\n\nAlways disregards my  sexual boundaries (which is entirely my fault I overlooked, as in, I  should have ditched him the first time he did that).\n\nHis  place is on the way to my college. I'm having triggers and heart  palpitations everyday when I go to my college. This is just the tip of  the iceberg of what he did to me and what is happening to me right now.  I'm coping this whole situation through reading similar experiences of  people and recovery tips online. Its not that things ended w him that  hurt me. but It took me so long to realize the abuse and brain washing  using intermittent reward and punishment, coercive control and  withholding normal empathetic, emotional reactions to lower my self  esteem and CONSTANT LIES. As long as I was quiet things were just fine,  the moment I started to speak up, things got toxic, he said. In reality,  it was never fine. I cried everyday praying things will get better.\n\nThe post I made months ago :)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships\\_advice/comments/x2nymu/should\\_i\\_wait\\_or\\_run/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships_advice/comments/x2nymu/should_i_wait_or_run/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nI've  never dated anyone before and for starters I was ready to get some  pretty basic hurt, not a freakin psychopath who gave me trust issues and  severe trauma. It's brutal out here. I checked his IG a week ago and it  seems he started seeing someone else already. Even though I feel free  now and I feel sorry for the new girl, it hurts so much. How can he  dispose me like I'm nothing. No point holding on to the good lies he  told me.\n\nWorld is so unfair. I  know cliche, but I'm experiencing a whole lot of transformation of how I  see people now. I really don't think my story is unique. Can I get some  advice from people? What more should I do to recover quickly from this?  and what else should I look out for in the future, how do I trust/test  people? and most important of all, how do I know if someone is actually  manipulating/gaslighting me or am I just overthinking?

She once told me she hated that I always looked for the good in a bad situation. I admit it could get annoying, but I‚Äôve worked on that and she has never brought it up again. \n13. This is a long distance relationship. When I came back home for Christmas (she lives in this country where my parents live as well), we fought the first and third days of me being here.

My colleague, John was hired a couple of months before my reassignment,  he‚Äôs in another department but our work is connected, so he will only be consulted on some details, but would not have a say in it.\n\n\nI swiftly began all preparations as I‚Äôm aware that our CEO (Will) wants this to be completed as soon as possible.

I stood my ground and said my project will go ahead no matter what he says.\n\n\nWill has put Tom in charge of approvals for this project as he is very busy, however, i realised that Tom has been parroting what John is saying about my project which then caused the delay.\n\n\nI have spoken with HR about Tom and what is happening. Suddenly Tom responded to me to say that if I think the software is ok, then I should proceed. I then rushed things to catch up. \n\nDuring this, John has been bitchy and each time I shut him down.

But at the same time, the last couple of years with my wife have been really tough. We've been married 4 years.\n\nThere were signs before fertility trouble. I've been bored in the bedroom for some time (we only do missionary or girl on top). Suggestions of foreplay (I'm very into reciprocating oral, hand stuff etc), toys, lingerie, role play, anything else have fallen on deaf ears.\n\nWe've had sex three times in the past 18 mos. I've tried suggesting we go on dates, both before the baby and after - no dice. Recently she suggested we get time away from the kid and hang out with her friends to play cards. When I said \"ok, but I'd also like to plan a date night\" she ignored it. \n\nWe have issues outside sex too. My wife tends to dictate how and what we do around the house, activities etc. Its stifling my sense of adventure, and any pushback on daily activities / chores is a problem for her. I'm asserting myself more (\"no, I'm cleaning the stove this way\") and staying firm when she tries to tell me things I remember didn't happen etc. That part feels good and is something I've needed to work on for a long time. But her controlling behavior on little things drives me NUTS. Why can't she let some things go? \n\nI'm not blameless here. When I get mad, I have a tendency to pull away or to blow up. In the past 6 mos I've definitely made strides controlling my temper. It seems to go along with being more assertive. \n\nIf you're still here, thanks for reading to this point. \n\nLadies, what might my wife be feeling?

Apart from work, we don't really have a lot going on.\n\nThe other day we were talking and she said that I don't like to spend time with her and just want to do my hobbies and spend time with my friends. These hobbies she refers to are things like playing board games with friends, do jigsaw puzzles, go bowling, listen to music, browse videos on my computer, and running/jogging. I told her that invite her whenever I do these and she almost always declines and said \"those are your hobbies and not what I enjoy.\" \n\nNow for board games, I was trying to have some friends come over to play board games with us about once a month, but end up only having this like 4-6 times per year. Whenever we have this, I always ask her what game she wants to play and what friends she wants to invite to try to involve her more (she claims she likes playing board games when I ask and even will search out and purchase new games). She never invites anyone and I end up inviting 2 or 3 friends (1 of which is a mutual friend we shared in HS). When we start playing games, she often just wants to talk about random things and not pay really close attention, which causes me to be frustrated because of how infrequently we actually have people over for games. After an hour or 2, she gets bored and leaves the room so my friends and I continue. If I suggest any game other than the 1 or 2 specific games she happens to want to play, she won't even participate at all. When my friends leave, she complains that they stayed too long and she felt too embarrassed to spend the time how she wanted (watching Korean dramas). We play games in the basement, and the TV isn't in the basement, but in a room directly up the stairs from the basement. My friends typically stay 4-5 hours. We usually all eat lunch together first (my wife included) before playing games and when they leave my wife always says how starving she is and how they stayed so long and just wanted them to leave so we could eat dinner. Usually after 3.5-4 hours of games, she will constantly text me saying how hungry she is and asking when we are going to be done. Several weeks or months after playing, I'll bring up having games again and she never seems interested and I feel like I can't invite my friends over because it seems to somehow \"ruin\" her time or make her jealous that I \"just want to hang out with my friends and not her.\"\n\nSo I asked her what her hobbies were (already knowing the answer) and how she wants to spend time together. She said that she just likes to read books and watch Korean dramas. I told her that I read a lot of the same books (and attend the monthly book club she hosts at our house) and we discuss the books. I've occasionally watched some of those dramas, but they aren't my thing. These aren't really ideal things for us to do together in the meaningful way she seems to envision wanting. We started watching some other types TV shows (things we find on Netflix and agree to watch) together so I asked her about that and she said that those shows she watches just so we can spend time together and isn't what she really wants to watch. \n\nI feel like we spend a lot of time just sitting around in each others' presence where we are both on our phones or we talk, which seems to often consist of her airing her grievances. I'm often frustrated and bored after a while of this. She doesn't seem to want to do much of anything I suggest. I also feel like 80% of her conversation is complaints and I feels she complains about something almost every single day: work, people at work, her family, my family, some random thing from the past, something someone said, etc. I feel like I'm pretty patient and listen to all of this, but I'm just getting fed up with all the negativity. I've eventually told her this, but it doesn't really change the overwhelming level of complaints she seems to have.\n\nThe one thing we both enjoy is traveling for vacations, but this only happens a handful of times per year. I also am feeling less motivated to plan these as well as nearly every vacation, there's 1 day where she seems pouty and will say things like \"my day is ruined and I just want to go home\" and act like everything we do is miserable for her for a bit. She eventually recovers from this mood and thoroughly enjoys the vacation and will say how great it is and be enthusiastic for most of it.\n\nThings didn't used to be this bad and she used to seem to enjoy things I did more, but I don't even know what she wants us to do together. Does anyone have any ideas on fulfilling ways to spend time together? Is there maybe something deeper going on that I need to try to address? It seems we are both very unfulfilled, but I don't know how to improve this."

She broke up with me almost one year ago because I told her I wouldn‚Äôt be able to move to her country and so, if we wanted the relationship to work, she would have to move here (big mistake, I know).\n\nDespite the breakup, we kept talking from time to time. The conversations were mostly about us giving updates on each others‚Äô lives and me telling her that I had realised my big mistake and would be ready to start again. She would always reply that, although she still loved me, she was not in the mood for a long distance relationship.\n\nThings remained stationary for a couple of months until she tells me that she went to bed with her best friend. I ask her why she‚Äôs telling me this, and she replies that she thinks it‚Äôs right for me to know and that it‚Äôs not a big deal because we are not together anymore. I thought she was right.\n\nAfter some time I notice she starts publishing pictures of them together so I ask her if they are officially together now, at which she says that he‚Äôs only a friend with benefits and that she has told him multiple times that I am the one she loves, so I shouldn‚Äôt worry about him. I lose my temper at this, telling her it‚Äôs not fair that she shows up every once in a while telling me she still loves me but that she is going to bed with another man. I tell her I think she‚Äôs just playing with me, so we have an argument and decide to stop talking altogether.\n\nFast forward a couple of months, she texts me saying that she has only recently realised that her friendship with benefits was starting to become a real romantic relationship, so she decided to dump him because deep down she still felt like she loved me. I was happy to hear this because I too still had feelings for her and so we started texting on a regular basis again. At one point she even invites me to go on a trip with her next January, which I accept. \n\nOne day while we were texting she confesses to me that she had continued to go to bed with his (now ex) friend with benefits during this whole time, but that her heart was only thinking about me so I shouldn‚Äôt be worried. I again lose my temper, telling her that she could have any relationship she wanted, but she shouldn‚Äôt come back to me every time saying that she still loves me, knowing full well how much I still care about her. I had also started getting paranoid any time she told me she was going out with someone else, thinking it was him. So I tried to convince myself that the best thing to do was to just stop talking with her and start over. I decided that we had to talk about this in person, thinking it would help me close this chapter and get over her once and for all. So I reached her in real life and we spent some days together (like normal friends).\n\nIn retrospect, this turned out to be not so good of an idea since it only made me feel worse. Luckily enough, my friends helped me get through this bad period and I thought I was out of it for good.\n\nWe had not talked for weeks after the trip, when all of a sudden she texts me asking me how my life was going. We start talking again and, being the dumbass that I am, I start thinking that maybe she has finally decided to get back together so I ask her if it‚Äôs okay for her to give us a second chance. And she says she is seriously considering this idea, but she still has to think. Maybe the vacation we have planned for January will help her decide, she adds.\n\nNeedless to say, I feel over the moon, but at the same time I start getting paranoid again. I start overthinking every time she says she is going out with friends or that she will spend the night at someone else‚Äôs place. Yesterday the same scenario happens and I snap, saying that I‚Äôm having trouble trusting her and that I would like more reassurance on her part whenever she tells me she is going to see her friends. She rightly says that we are not together, and that, again, she has the right to do everything she wants as long as she is single.\n\nThis morning I decide to call her, apologising for my controlling and paranoid behaviour, and for ruining her night out, finally agreeing with what she had said last night. She reassures me saying that it‚Äôs normal to overthink and that I shouldn‚Äôt worry about anything. But I still had that hunch from yesterday, so I ask her where she is. She replies she is at her ex‚Äôs house and that she has slept with him last night. \n\nI have a massive breakdown and start crying. At the same time she says that maybe she was wrong and maybe we are not ready to get back together because we keep hurting each other. She suggests we stop talking for good and perhaps try and find a new love. She also says that she doesn‚Äôt like the fact that every time she shows some interest towards me, I immediately expect her to act as I we were together (aka I expect her not to go to bed with anyone). Lastly, she again says that she can do whatever she wants as long as she is single and that I shouldn‚Äôt feel upset because her and I are just friends. We agreed to give us a couple of days to think about this.\n\nNow I feel awful thinking that I have ruined my last chance with her."

I am usually the one to initiate, which is fine, but it has been like that for awhile now. so I asked her if everything was good and she said yea of course. this went on for awhile with me initiating going out....and her hanging out/going out with other friends beside me, which is fine because we all have our own friend groups....but i asked again and she basically said that she doesn't always want to hangout because the guys tend to talk to me....I'm not really sure how to react to this because I have a boyfriend and I'm not seeking out a guy in any way...I want to go out because I want to spend time with my friend...She's single and says she's happy too so I don't see the problem here. \n\nI can see how it might be frustrating because there was this one guy and we were all talking and it was casual, not flirty. Then he goes \"so how long have you guys been single\" (which I thought was kinda a weird question tbh but whatever) and I responded oh I'm actually seeing someone. He definitely looked a little bummed and then started talking to my friend more...so i don't know if she just doesn't want to be second...regardless, I should still be able to hang out with my friend....\n\ntldr: single friend has been icing me out because she feels like she feels like I am getting all the attention even though I have a boyfriend...."

I have had my feelings used against me in the past. So I just don't talk about em. I finally say something after a few days, and it just kinda came out as word vomit. And I told her that I felt our relationship wasn't getting a fair chance since she started talking to this ex recently. Well turns out she has confessed everything to her mother..about the sexts and the talking to her exes..but hasn't said shit to me..but now I feel like garbage having given her an ultimatum..and now she is hurt because I am doing that..I asked her to stop talking to her ex gf or I couldnt stick around.\n\nEdit. Sorry I am like super emotionally charged up about this\n\nEdit edit: I love her very much and want to give her the benefit of the doubt and a second chance..but I feel now that it may not work out between us.. but if it doesnt work out..itll be my fault."

In his program he has a tight knit of people that he studied with that include mostly him and two other girls. His classes are very difficult, so I understand the need to create community with like minded people in order to make it through. I have never protested, or brought up any sort of jealousy or comment even when he‚Äôd be going over to their houses without telling me to study. He has also reassured me that the two girls have boyfriends so again, I do not have a problem and I trust my boyfriend. Last week he brought up a ‚Äòend of the year‚Äô snowboarding trip him and the other people in his class were going to go on and that I was invited. He said the original plan was that him and one of the girls were going to drive down alone together, but I was invited. This idea of them making a plan to drive down alone together and then invite me as an after thought made me a little uneasy but I didn‚Äôt say anything. Today, I recently got sick and hurt my back so I wont be able to go. He brought it up again today that they were leaving tomorrow morning and that him and this girl were driving down together. So I decided to bring up my discomfort and ask if it was weird that they had made these plans to drive down together without asking me if I would be okay with it first, and then asked if the situation was reversed how he would feel. His response was to get very frustrated with me and say if I had a problem I should have brought it up earlier and that he was just not going to go and then stormed out of the house‚Ä¶ I feel really bad because I do trust him and this girl and I really shouldn‚Äôt have made that comment I just through it would be a basic respect thing when you‚Äôre in a relationship.. I doubt he will want to talk to me today since he‚Äôs studying (at their house again) and I don‚Äôt want to be represented as a crazy jealous girlfriend either. What do I do?"

I accepted. However, he told me he needs to ask his friends if that would be okay with them. He told me he would ask in the groupchat but he ended up asking the organiser and the boy told him something like \"Well I don't really have a good relationship with OP (me) but you have to ask the others\"\nThis confused me because I never really talked to that boy so it's not like we are on bad terms or anything. It was just weird. I guess this scared my boyfriend off and instead of asking the others we just watched the match at his place, but I felt a little guilty that he didn't get to spend it with his friends because it seems that they don't want me there. \nThe thing is, I have no clue why they don't want me to hang out with them and he doesn't know either. \nThey also took a few pictures of us together during the class and we don't know why they do this but with that and what happened with the football match my boyfriend told me he suspects they don't like me for some reason. He plans to confront them about it though.\nHe was also invited to a new years eve party with the same group and he wants me to be there too but suspects he will not really get positive feedback if he asks if I can come. He has yet to ask though. \n\nThis is all making me feel really bad and unwanted. I find it stupid that this group of people who I never wronged just seem so off put by the idea of me hanging out with them. I guess I am also bothered by the fact that my boyfriend is putting off even asking them at all or confronting them. I know he wanted to watch the football match with them too and I know he wants to spend new years eve with them as well as with me.  It makes me feel as if he has to choose between me or them constantly and that because of this he spends less time with his friends. I feel guilty because of this but I also feel like he is ashamed of me because they don't seem to like me for whatever reason. I get that he doesn't want to make his friends uncomfortable if they don't want me there but I don't know how to feel about this. I don't know what to do about this anymore and if this persists I feel like it will just become a bigger problem. I also feel like it is such a ridiculous situation. \n\nPlease I need some advice.\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend's friend group doesn't seem too keen on the idea of me hanging out with them and I feel bad about it."

                "body": "I met this girl on Facebook a year ago. We were long distance friends for a bit, texting constantly throughout the day, short phone calls couple times a week, occasionally a super long call lasting 2-3 hours long into the morning. She's been to see me a few times, but it's been mainly me going to see her, 7 hours away. It's more challenging for her to come see me. She has 2 dogs, that she brings with her (which is fine with me because i love dogs and have one of my own), and her car isn't reliable, it's getting older and breaking down a bit. So I've been understanding about not coming to see me as much. She was raped by her older brother when she was a little girl. She never went to therapy for it and says she'll take it to her grave, her brother is still part of her life and they're close. And she has had toxic romantic relationships throughout her life, her previous boyfriends were abusive, verbally and physically and also cheaters. Her and I didn't meet for 3-4 months, it was all talking in the beginning and building a friendship but we did have a sexual component and it's been pretty wild. There's been some red flags since the beginning that I ignored. Her liking older guys isn't the issue for me. It's that she has a 68 year old male friend (retired Dr, and my gf is a nurse- they used to work together, he was friendly with all the nurses, but they developed a special bond, and they've been friends for like 3 years). Before my gf and I began talking, her and this guy got Covid together and they decided to quarantine together so they could take care of each other. She told me she slept in his bed (clothed, she says). What was I going to say? It is weird and inappropriate to me, def not normal, but we weren't together. Also this guys ex wife tried to run my gf over with her car, again before her and I were together. My gf says the ex wife is insecure and jealous and psycho. To me this is not right. The ex wife may have mental issues but I'm sure she was feeling what I'm feeling, that the relationship between my gf and this guy is too close. Over the course of our relationship tho, once we were boyfriend and girlfriend, my gf and him would do things that were inappropriate. Just the sheer amount of time they spend together bothers me. One time this guy had a panic attack and drove himself to the ER at 5am and texted my gf. Fine, whatever. Well my gf literally lost her mind over it, waking ME up at 5am telling me I need to pray for this guy and she is so upset over it. Like holy shit, calm down. He had a panic attack. He's a grown man. As soon as she got out of work, drove soup and sandwiches over to his house, spent 2-3 hours there, then they went back to her place to walk her dogs and then went for a long drive at night to go get slushies and hang out til like 10 or 11 at night. It caused a fight with us. I said it's too much. This is stuff boyfriend and girlfriend do. It's one thing to bring food over and hang out for a bit, but that's overboard. My gf just says I'm insecure and jealous and it actually makes me question myself if I am being that way or if this is really not normal and completely inappropriate. It's not just any guy. He has confessed to being in love w her and wishing he could give her marriage and kids, has made comments about her tits (she told me this), discouraged her from being with my because I'm a teacher and can't provide for her, has said some super abusive and toxic things to my gf in the early stages of our relationship which used to really upset her and it would be this huge thing which always ended in her getting distant with me. Ice always felt live I've had to fight to be her bf. This guy mows cuts her lawn, does her oil change, fixes things in her house, he stops over with food at 10:30 at night if she's having a hard time, she goes to his house for dinner then back over the next morning for breakfast, they do activities together on the weekend.. she says he's like a father figure to her.  My gf's family adores him, he brings her dad gifts, visits her dad with and without her, is her plus 1 to weddings and family events, her sister and husband invited the two of them out to dinner like a double date, she went to his house and they drove to a giant bonfire together recently.. it's not the fact that he's a male that bothers me, although I am a guy and know what guys think and I wasn't wrong about this.. so one night after a wedding they attended, he told her he was in love with her and if only he was younger he would marry her and want to give her kids. My gf laughed this off. She would never set any kind of boundaries with this guy. You would think after that she would take a step back and not continue to spend so much time with him because that sends the wrong message. And to be honest I feel that it's not considerate of my feelings them acting like this. She doesn't know what clear boundaries mean besides not being in his life. Napping in his bed and acting like bf/gf/married, vs not being in his life. There's a huge gap there. And she says I'm insecure and don't understand how close their friendship is, she says it's unconventional and no one gets their bond. But this guy used to verbally abuse her and say messed up things to her and it would really effect her and she would then want space from me! I said no that's not ok and put a stop to that right away. I told her I didn't want to hear about his outbursts because it causes her to want space from me and ends up in a fight for us because I hate how he would speak to her and how he treated her and thought it was f'ed up. One day my gf said to me that one of her friends had an infection and she wanted to catheterize them and asked me how I felt and I right away asked her if it was this guy and she said yes. I said absolutely not. He can go get it done professionally at the doctors. Or do it himself. I don't want her holding his dick, staring her right in the face, etc etc. It pissed me off and hurt me that she even thought this was ok to ask me about given the situation. She has admitted to me before wanting to cancel our FaceTime date because she wanted to stay at his house. She would assure me that she has no physical or romantic feelings for him and if she wanted to be with him, she wouldn't waste her time dating me who's 7 hours  away and assured me she loved me. But to me, someone who loves somebody and is happy, doesn't pull this shit. She would always bring his name up- in bed, in the car, over the phone, out to dinner, his name is always in my face. She says he is a father figure to her, but I never met the guy. She asked him once if he would meet me and he said it wasn't essential. On the other hand all of my friends have been dying to meet her because they saw how happy she makes me and they want to be introduced to her. That's normal. All of our fights have been about this guy. Recently I'd say about a month or so ago, she took a nap in his bed. Now she lives 10 min away. I got upset when she told me this and she got upset and said she would do it anyway and not tell me, she can never do anything right, everything w this guy is always an issue, etc. telling me I'm insecure. She is also pregnant by the way. 3 months along. Everyone asks me am I sure it's my child and I say yes. I believe her that this isn't his baby. This guy has set my gf up with another man before we began dating, a few years before actually. So I don't think the old guy and my gf are physical but I just think it's a very strange relationship that may have to do with her sexual trauma and maybe she feels a pull to him. She's extremely defensive about their friendship and has made it clear to me several times she will never kick him out. To be honest, when she tells me she doesn't know what  \"clear boundaries\" are, I honestly don't know how she doesn't. My brain automatically thinks in my interactions w female coworkers and friends throughout the day to act respectful as if my gf was standing right there and take into consideration my gf's feelings, basically not flirt or entertain anybody or put myself in compromising positions. It's a no brainer for me. This guy bought her a $200 necklace and my gf just says \"it's an EMF protection necklace!\" Like I actually care what kind it is, it's still a $200 piece of jewelry that she wears constantly. She told me she stopped staying at his house late til 1am or 2am. That she doesn't see him anymore. And I simply say, \"yeah, as of what, 7 days ago??\" It's just us going in circles. Since she got pregnant, she has been extremely depressed and resentful of me that I'm not just going to uproot and move there in the middle of all this chaos. I have full time job w benefits, a small business, and another part time job and I don't want to take a big pay cut to move there and also don't want to leave my family. I've told her this from day 1. She's told me from day 1 that she wants to move to my state, called me her future husband.. one time I was visiting her and at her sisters baby shower and I walked by her and her younger sis talking and the younger sis says to her \"I thought you were dating *\\_\\_\\_*.\" I turned and saw my gf's face was beet red. It was not fun hearing that. But of course according to my gf, her younger sis is only 13 and you can't go by what she says. In my opinion, their relationship is weird, inappropriate and too close and my gf isn't treating me with respect and since finding out she was pregnant she has treated me so poorly, stopped putting any and all effort into our relationship. When I visited a month ago, she practically ignored me. The little things she used to do, the little displays of physical affection, the loving text messages, sharing of our day w photos and videos, just everything has sucked. I haven't made her feel like she has to move here but as her bf I told her, I found a place for us to live here that's spacious and nice and I would take care of the rent and support her and the baby and I'd help her move, help her with things through the pregnancy, basically I've been trying to be the most loving supportive bf I can possibly be in this situation besides move. Would I consider it if things were different and we weren't having issues like this? Hell yes I would consider it. At least temporarily so she can go through the pregnancy and the baby's first year or two there with her family. But I know moving there w the current state of things would be a mistake and I'd end up leaving within 6 months because we'd be miserable. Baby aside, our relationship absolutely sucks now. My gf basically provoked me a ton throughout our short relationship by entertaining inappropriate things with this guy and doing things that are inappropriate. And he has been doing the same. He discouraged her from being with me early on because I'm a teacher and am not worth millions like him. My gf just laughs this stuff off, says it's out of her control, and allowed him to shit all over our relationship and I honestly think she likes the attention from him. Which is confusing because I give her so much attention. Our sex life like I said earlier is wild, we are such a perfect match there, she also believes that. But she has told me before he's there, and I'm 7 hours away. He's also basically the only person she hangs out with. They're basically married. And do everything but fuck and make out. But he would love to. It all came crashing down a week ago when I realized I have not been able to get over the things that have happened and how my gf would initially react when I bring up how uncomfortable it makes me (she'd blow up at me, say I'm insecure, jealous, don't understand their friendship, tell me she'll do things anyway and just not tell me, such as nap in his bed).. I realized I haven't been able to get over it, that i don't completely trust her, because at some point he crosses a boundary or she does, and I just sit around waiting for it to happen,and just hearing his name triggers me at this point. This is not an isolated incident either. There's been another friend who lurks around and disrespects me/our relationship because he wants to fuck her as well. Her and I would be in bed and he'll start blowing up her phone w calls and texts at 6am. Says things like he needs his fix. My gf will ignore for a few days then throw him a breadcrumb basically then it starts all over again, my gf complains to me how she is just not available and doesn't like when he does that, and in my head I'm thinking to myself, yes she does like the attention and if she really wanted to set a boundary she would, and it can be done in a way that isn't rude. Anyway I broke up with her a week ago after all of this, and most recently the last few months when she's visited me or I've visited her, she turns down every suggestion I have to do something together and wanted to just be depressed, sleep or text with that guy. So I told her look, we can be friendly, cordial, and I will do my best to coparent from afar, but i told her I don't want to tolerate this kind of behavior from a gf. I deserve better. There's no healthy communication, loyalty, respect, trust, effort, on her part. Me I have been fighting for this relationship for a while, voicing my concerns, coming up with solutions on how to make it work, and she's just done because she says I'm insecure and somethings always an issue with this guy. I'm extremely upset, I didn't want to break up, as terrible as it sounds, I love her and want to raise the baby together, and make this work, but her actions show me something completely different. I worry that we won't be able to reconcile in the future. I feel like I would need this guy to be gone from her life and I just don't see that happening ever. She said she wants god to remove these issues from her, wants god to tell her what boundaries are appropriate and if/when god wants this guy out of her life. I love god but I think that's bullshit. She doesn't went help. Says she does but really doesn't. I have explained over and over how this guy and situation makes me feel and it's like she doesn't get what a healthy platonic friendship w a male looks like and how to set boundaries when one person crosses the line repeatedly, she's crossed the line too. She can't possibly be this dumb and think it's all ok. She says she isn't romantic w him or physically attracted to him but im just not comfortable with all that's happened and I don't think I can be ok going to her baby shower with him there and him basically being more involved in my child's life than me. Recently she went to him upset that she won't be able to pay her rent and he offered to pay her entire rent every month. Also bought her a pregnancy pillow which was something i was going to do the day that I found that out. I felt like he overstepped again and if he doesn't overstep then she does and I'm always on edge wondering what's going to happen next with them. Even her just going to his house 10 min away, getting in his truck and driving to a big bonfire together makes me upset because they act like bf/gf, or her sister and her husband inviting the two of them out to dinner like a double date.."

                "body": "TL/DR : Boyfriend doesn't feel like I put enough effort in the relationship but I don't know how to make it better/function like a normal girlfriend\n\nApologies as this is a bit long, I'm upset and struggling to make my thoughts make sense\n\n\nMe (25F) and my bf(27m) have been together for just over 4 years, moved in together last year.\n\nHe is in the armed forces and over the last year he has been gone for over half the year due to training/deployment. I have moved across the country to be with him when he was stationed at the base we are living at currently, and I have struggled to make any real friendships in the area due to working from home for most of the year, and I feel that this amongst other things such as him being gone for so long and issues with my mental health (medicated, not too relevant) I've become a bit of a recluse, not used to social contact, don't actively seek it out. I have since started a new job where I interact with actual people.\n\nDue to him being away for so long I've gotten used to a bit of a routine and I spend a lot of time alone. I started a new job also and the hours are taking me a while to get used to so I am tired a lot of the time/want to take a nap after work, as I really struggle getting sleep with him in the bed with me, again as he's been gone for long.\n\nHe has just told me he feels like we're two completely separate people that just happen to share a house, he's not happy with the lack of communication and affection, and not happy that I don't suggest to do anything together, and he doesnt like that it falls on him to instigate activities/conversation, which is all fair/reasonable because in reality we don't really do anything together.\nWhat brought this on was me not wanting to move my pc desk from the dining room where its been since March to upstairs (because I really couldn't be bothered, and also I vape so it's more convenient to be downstairs, I didn't personally see it as a big deal but I was wrong). After he voiced his opinion i told him we can do the move and spend time upstairs but he said we'll do it another time. I have apologised for making him feel sad/bad/neglected but things are awkward.\n\nMy problem is I have genuinely not noticed this to be an issue as I'm used to being alone for so long, and since he's been back he's mostly seemed to be in a bad mood a lot and wouldn't tell me what's wrong so I figured I'd leave him to it until he was ready, as he normally struggles to have conversations about thoughts and feelings. This hasn't seemed to be an issue this week.\n\nAt this point I don't even know how to start a normal conversation. I feel like all my social skills have erased themselves. I feel like I put a mask on when I go to work but as soon as I finish I could easily not even utter a single word the whole day. I just sort of exist i guess? I don't even know.\n\nAnyway, I moved across country, changed jobs, tried my best to sort out my mental health (with his support) and I'm desperately trying to get myself a better future by starting uni next year. I've done the above to support him in his career and to make sure I don't become a burden in the future (My previous job was a dead end call centre and I wouldn't be able to do that and still somehow match his earnings in the future, I don't want to put us in a position where he's the primary breadwinner as the thought gives me anxiety and I don't want to be lesser than if that makes sense? Like I want us to be equals.\n\nWe've had a heart to heart a couple months ago where he said what he wants from a partner is someone who does what they can to better themselves, has aspirations, goals, and not smoking etc. I'm trying to meet those expectations because I really love him and I want to spend my life with him, and ive struggled with the above due to depression and just sort of giving up in the past. I am planning on quitting smoking but currently it is a crutch for me, after a conversation with my doctor she believes I'm quitting only for him and not for myself and until I'm fully ready in myself it'll be really hard. \n\nBut from the conversation we've had today I'm scared he doesn't want the relationship to continue, he obviously didn't say that but I feel like I'm not putting enough effort into the relationship but I just don't know/understand how to do it, I somehow can't start a conversation with him, I can't bring myself to ask him to hang out or do couple things cause in my head, he's just doing his own thing, like playing games with his friends and stuff  and I don't want to bother him, but that's not good enough. I don't know what's good enough anymore. It's like I've forgotten how to be in a relationship. \n\nOur relationship has been really good this whole time really, we never really argue, we'll have an occasional disagreement but it doesn't usually take long to get resolved.\n\nI'm just so scared at the moment. I moved away from all my friends and family to live with him and I have no support network where we are now. I'm scared that he's going to end things, I'm scared ill have to move back with my mother (long story, difficult relationship), and I'll lose this new job which is a really good opportunity as I'm being trained in management, this is the first job that will open doors for me in the future, and due to various trips (family weddings in different countries, both my family and his), needing to buy a new car, bills etc, I have basically no savings to fall back upon if this relationship fails and I have to restart life elsewhere. \n\nBut I don't even wanna think about that. I want this relationship to work. I want us to work it out. But also I don't know how to even function with another person anymore. How do I have a normal natural conversation with him?  Obviously I know that this can be solved with an adult conversation, you know like the adults we are, but I don't know how to go about it/express my feelings without potentially guilting him if I express the paragraph above, as I'm scared if I say all that he'll just not bring up how he feels again,  and that's not healthy either.\n\nI just don't feel like I'm good enough for him\n\nI just don't know what to do, what can I do to make myself better at being a girlfriend?"

And -for a while it all went smoothly. So when my Ma wanted to talk to me yesterday, I didn't think nothing. Oh boi.\n\nYou see, my mother and I have very different ideas of Christmas. My mother has it in her mind that it needs to be going a \"certain way\". Not even because she likes Christmas. It's a matter of \"just is\". This includes 3 dish dinners without break, not talking over Christmas music and me showing up at least during one Christmas day.\n\nMeanwhile, I hate Christmas. With my parents, mostly. Every year I wished for it to fall flat. I hate the perfection, the beatings over fucking nothing and the tradition over me having \"ruined Christmas because X. It was only when I spend last years Christmas at my extended family, when I felt like the first time being \"okay\" with Christmas. \n\nNow, my mother is using the fact that I kinda been in a parasitic situation with them against me. And tbf I do feel stupid for happily accepting free food and laundry (college student y'know) without thinking of the catch. Partially because she's clinically insane (PPD, BPD, Socio/Psychopathy and shit) and just lives in her little make-pretend world, so I thought I was safe. But I underestimated the spirit of Christmas and even worse, she can't listen to empathy/emotions (only will switch it to herself). But every rational comment falls flat as well:\n\nCome to ext.Family as well? -No. [Aunt] once disinvited her + the rest of family for being too overwhelmed to host a Christmas party. Won't go.\n\nI could come Sylvester? -No. They already invited [mothers friend]. Couch will be full.\n\nCan't see that Christmas becomes hell if we try to host it? She will end up crying, my father goes out for a \"walk\" (hours) and I will just hate my life, all over again? -I'd be a guest. That'd be different. It's just hell if I had done what I was told and pick up the pace. I know I'm an idiot for messing with crazy for sweet, sweet benefits. Is this Karma? Should I just tough it out\n\nI'm throwing money together for a new laptop. It's a bit tough as I need to pay driving lessons off as well. Plus college and stuff. Sadly, my stay has already been organized (plus I'd rather unalive myself with a rusty spoon than spending another Christmas like this), but now I need some strategy to keep her from going ballistic. At least till my midterm is over. Tips??"

He‚Äôs stopped complimenting me and has become very irritable. We don‚Äôt get into arguments often, as I try to avoid upsetting him. He‚Äôs never hit me, but usually ends up breaking something or punching a hole in the wall. Setting him off is really easy so I‚Äôm practically walking on eggshells. Pregnancy has made me quite depressed, but I make sure he doesn‚Äôt see me upset/crying. I usually save my crying spells for the ride to/from work when I‚Äôm alone. He absolutely hates seeing my face anything but happy. Despite telling him that my depression is caused by my hormones/stress (I just graduated and I‚Äôve been studying for board/licensure exams), he takes this very personally and always tells me he‚Äôs going to ‚Äúget tired‚Äù of me eventually and leave. \n\nThese past few months he‚Äôs been refusing to let me pay any bills, which I feel is fueling his anger towards me. I tried sending him the money and he sends it right back. I work a regular 9-5 and have been really exhausted. I try my best to do household chores and to make sure everything is clean and he has food to eat. I hate that he‚Äôs not letting me pay for anything because I feel like this is constantly being held over my head. Whenever he‚Äôs upset, he reminds me that I don‚Äôt pay for shit and that I have no right to be tired. \n\n\nWhenever I have issues I want to discuss quietly, he begins to yell over me and remind me that his childhood was difficult and that he‚Äôs had to deal with a lot before me, basically avoiding the current problem. He immediately blows up and it almost always reduces me to tears. The pregnancy has made me quite insecure, which I understand is my problem to deal with. Noticing his changing behavior stings a lot, especially when he tells me I look ‚Äúugly‚Äù whenever I put on makeup and dress up. The constant insults have reduced my confidence to shit, but he tells me he hates that I‚Äôm insecure. I really try my best to look good, but I‚Äôm always met with negative feedback. \n\nThe outbursts have made me just keep problems to myself. We didn‚Äôt discuss anything for two weeks and everything was fine. I‚Äôve told him in the past that I find it rude when he blatantly stares at other women in front of me to the point that they notice. I don‚Äôt mind him looking, but he keeps staring and it honestly makes me feel like shit. I just get in my head about all the times he insults my appearance and it hurts. I never said anything, but he noticed I caught him yesterday. I stayed quiet for a moment and he kept insisting that I tell him why I‚Äôm not smiling. I wasn‚Äôt angry, I was just afraid because I knew he would blow up when we got home. When I told him that I didn‚Äôt appreciate that he kept insisting I tell him, he got very angry. I told him I can‚Äôt work on my insecurities/fix the problems if I have to speak them into existence and then face his anger each time. It feels like I lose no matter what. He told me I need to do a better job at faking being happy around him. I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. I‚Äôm hoping to get on antidepressants as soon as the baby is born. I‚Äôve tried scheduling virtual therapy appointments, but he works from home and I‚Äôm scared that he‚Äôll hear me talking to the therapist from the other room. Every time I told him I have an appointment to speak to someone, coincidentally, his clients for that time block cancelled. It feels like I‚Äôm up against a wall."

For context: me (37M) and my family are hispanic and progressive democrats but my sister (45F no kids) slid into the right wing pipeline maybe a decade ago. \n\nAnyways sometime after the election of Donald Trump her boyfriend and I were drinking late at night and the subject of politics comes up. I tried being respectful and there were certain things we just have to agree to disagree on, at some point he just snapped and started calling everybody in our family terrible names and accusations. I mean calling my brother a pedophile and things like all democrats are pedophiles, conspiracy theories, and other unhinged rants. After I had enough of this I told him to go to bed and went for the door, and instead he stopped me, throwing his chest between the door and being very intimidating. He kept ranting about politics and other accusations against my family, pointing his finger at my chest, and trying to get me to push him off or something and threatened to fight me many times. At one point he snapped and began throwing a punch, and I just ducked and covered my head, but he stopped at the last minute and just screamed instead. To be fair, I did poke fun at his politics a lot and I did call him a loser several times, that I didn‚Äôt want to fight a family member late at night and this was just a loser activity, and multiple times trying to tell him to just let me go to bed. At another point he even told me I shouldn‚Äôt be dating white women (my wife is white) and that only white men should be dating white women. I laughed because he‚Äôs white dating an hispanic woman and he just said that‚Äôs different and that hispanic men are violent. Finally after maybe 20 minutes of the most unhinged conversation I‚Äôve heard in my life (way too much to list it all here) I was finally able to get inside the door and went to bed. I didn‚Äôt speak anything of it and have been mostly trying to keep the distance between him/them. \n\nNow it‚Äôs after covid and our family is starting to get together a lot again, he apparently has left her to live with his family in another state, but they are still ‚Äútogether‚Äù and talk everyday. But my sister is visiting family a lot and she wants to get everyone together. But I really don‚Äôt want to see this guy again and I don‚Äôt feel safe are around him, especially when people are drinking. The thing is, she and everybody is acting like this is just some ‚Äúdrunken political argument‚Äù and that both sides were wrong because I was calling him a loser and stuff. Well my family has discussed this at length and they don‚Äôt really like the guy either, they just say it‚Äôs who my sister has chosen and we have to respect her choice. But I really feel like this guy has it out for me especially because I‚Äôm dating a white woman, and that he would be likely to inflict violence against me again. I tried to tell this to my sister but she started crying and just made it out like I‚Äôm attacking her calling her boyfriend a loser, and that I just don‚Äôt like him because of his politics and race. I feel like she thinks she won‚Äôt find anybody else, so I was just trying to encourage her to start dating and to find somebody else, and that he was likely doing the same since they are not living together. She really didn‚Äôt want to hear that at all and it wasn‚Äôt received well. \n\nNobody is really understanding I literally just really don‚Äôt feel safe in his presence and that he would likely get violent towards me again. I really don‚Äôt want physical injury/death nor do I want some domestic violence charge or something because ‚Äúboth sides are at fault‚Äù. \n\nI was thinking of just saying, well maybe we can get together but nobody in the family should be allowed to drink?

I have BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder) and my main trigger is being abandoned/ left out no matter whether it is on purpose or not; I'm not from this country and have only lived in the UK for 4 years. I have a very difficult path coming to this country, I was almost escaping HK and my family because I didn't feel fit into the society there, and also my mum caused many layers of trauma to me; I started working on my English-speaking 6 years ago, even though I'm speaking/using it quite well now, there're still times I find I can't fully express myself or understand other English-speaking people; I don't have a home, I'm currently living in Airbnb and moving every 2-3 weeks because finding an accommodation nowadays in London is just too difficult.\\]\n\nSo I have a part-time retail job where I work with a group of people who are all very lovely, and I'd say it's quite rare that this is a group I feel very accepted and appreciated, including the manager. I've worked here for about 10 months and I had been really enjoying the dynamic. These people helped me a lot with my struggles (even emotional ones) and also, helped a lot with my personal growth. I almost never felt like this level of 'being accepted as who I am' from anywhere.\n\nBut then things changed when there were newcomers joining the group. One of the newcomers is an Asian Australian, she's 10 years younger than me, she's a very nice person and seems to get on very well with everyone (Let's call her A). In the group, there're these 3 boys/guys, they have very good chemistry and everyone loves them - I was at some point really close with one of the boys, let's call him S (he's British). But ever since A joined, I found she and S really like each other and every time the 3 of us are together, I just can't join the conversation. They probably have a lot of similarities, they're at a similar age so I think it's understandable that they get along; I did feel upset and jealous about that, and I expressed to S and another guy (Let's call him K, he grew up in this country) that I feel beaten up by her because she just gets everything easily. For example, S got her snacks from the staff room without her asking, or K bought a book after she said that book is good (she wasn't even recommending him to buy it, he bought it out of his own will, but when it comes to my recommendations on books and movies, K just doesn't seem appreciating). \n\nI felt like I can't be that much of an influence on the boys, and a lot of attention has been taken away from me. K explained that it's probably to do with A being culturally and language-wise, closer to them and it's easier to communicate. And I explained that's exactly why I feel upset because A somehow made me feel like my effort in English and fit into the country has been denied/ not working, which is a big denial for a non-English person, not to mention I have BPD.\n\nK and I were getting sort of closer to each other after I shared my struggles with S and A. Also, we work on the same rota where S and A work on another rota, so I meet K almost every shift. K is a similar age as me, he is a very kind and sensitive person, always taking care of others. He's a bit of that 'funny and flirty' type and is very open talking about mental health and therapy etc. I've always felt like K likes other people more than me, and I found it hard to make him happy/ to impress. For example, I got him bday snack/ I found his lost T-shirt/ I tagged him on Instagram stories, etc, and his reactions were all very minimal to those. But as we're on the same rota, I really wanted us to at least bond better. And I know I've done too much because there was a point when we were starting to get closer, and when I told him 'I want you to like me because we're colleagues and friends', this caused him a panic attack after he hearing that because it made him anxious and it was too much. (I've never caused anyone a panic attack and I still feel deeply guilty about this incident.)\n\nBut then we communicated, and I disclosed to him about my BPD. He was tip-toeing about if he only wants to be my colleague or if we can also be friends. There was not a clear line between what he wanted. But then again, we started to get closer, and it seems like he really did a lot of research about what is BPD. He asked me questions like 'if I say this, how did it feel in your brain?' I really appreciated how much effort he was giving, to know my condition better. People just avoid talking to me when they knew I have BPD, but he was different. I was being unreasonable to K for quite a lot of small events, but every time we'd talk and get over it. Also, K was really interested in my relationship with an ex-housemate whom I visited on a trip recently. These confused me a lot because I thought K was attracted to me. And because I thought he liked me, I started to like him too, which I was never attracted to him until recently. \n\nK tried to cut me off completely last week because 1. I asked him to sit next to me at a football pub night event with other colleagues, because I wasn't feeling well in that environment, and I felt left out in the group conversation, especially when A was getting a lot of attention and K just talked to her a lot 2. I accused him of flirting with another young colleague (10 years younger than me) but not me, based on my own insecurity of being an over-30-year-old woman... I knew I screwed up and I was trying to apologize to him and showed him I know he has made effort on making me feel better. I knew he got frustrated when every time I just got triggered no matter how hard he tried to communicate. But then he said he doesn't want a romantic NOR PLATONIC relationship with me, he doesn't want to be friends outside of work. He made it clear that he has no feelings for me, and he can't take my emotional burden anymore. \n\nI got very very hurt of course, to an extent that I needed to contact my therapist and called some hotlines for help. I felt like I failed the whole country and if this lovely group of people don't like me, where else can I go? Do I even have a future? Does my effort just so easily taken by someone who just naturally has it? - I understand the 'romantic feelings' might just be one-sided, which is painful but still fine. The 'no friendship outside work' part was what really got me. I felt like I was denied of everything I did to him nicely in the past, that I don't even deserve to be a friend - the most basic thing you can have with another human being. Not to mention he kept saying how lovely A is, and 'I feel closer to A as a friend'... this was like a knife cutting my neck. \n\nThere were 3 days we worked together but I ignored him on purpose even though he tried to ask how are you, because it was just too difficult for me. S was kind of being our 'middleman' to talk about what happened with both of us separately. Until S said 'the friendship doesn't work' - I got a big trigger and just won't stop crying during work hours, so I asked to talk to K face to face, and he said yes. It was last night, and we both apologized to each other, he explained he was just running out of options on how to communicate with me about setting his boundaries, and he knew the wording he used was hurtful. Everything was fine until we talked about A. \n\nK has said before that A is more compatible with him, she is more natural, and easy to talk to, and they share the same humor. I explained that I did try to talk to A (even though K said I distanced her on purpose, which make me feel unfair), I tried to have lunch with her and talk to her, but personally, I don't find myself really vibing with her, I don't find the dynamic interesting either - K immediately said 'She is interesting', and when I mentioned I think I'm caring, K immediately said 'She's caring too', he said he understands I've always been very generous (buying the group customized souvenirs for each of them), 'but caring comes in different ways' - it feels like he could only see my gestures as me wanting people's approval, and A is the real caring one. While I got people souvenirs/ food because I really thought of them during the trips, and I want to share how delicious the food is with them. It's all good intention and when I'm doing it, I'm not really caring but A is?...\n\nI explained I don't feel nice hearing that. K said he didn't mean A is more interesting than me. I asked him if he could maybe, knowing how A symbolizes something very important to trigger me, not to talk about her too nicely in front of me? K insists he won't, because that's unfair, and he wants me to understand that I have to accept some people just get closer but not with me, I have to accept that sometimes there are no reasons or answers why someone is more likable to some people. I understand he did this with good intentions and it's for my own good that I can overcome my insecurity and self-esteem issue, but I still found it harsh and somehow cruel when he knows I still have feelings for him, and he's talking nicely about another younger female.\n\nI don't know how to get out of this mindset and this is killing me. When I woke up this morning, the first thing I thought of was when he said 'She is interesting'... Just to be clear, I might be jealous, but I don't want to be her, I know my own strength, I know how good I am. The frustration is from me not getting why. What has she done that people acknowledge her so much and can see her values so much? How is the way she expresses and carries herself that I failed so much? I mean she seems emotionally healthy and stable (which is another knife for me as I didn't choose to have BPD), but I don't get why, and I wish there was some comfort for me, for my very very hard path coming to this country, way harder than hers. I deserve so much, I've experienced life very thoroughly, I'm a writer myself and proud of dealt with all the difficulties. But look how one conversation about A has got me into a very depressive state... \n\nI don't know what to do. I'm hoping for some advice but more importantly, being listened to. This article is ridiculously long, I'm so sorry, thank you for reading it."

About a year ago we moved in together and i began to notice his breath smelled. \n\nIt is Important to know that I'm Autistic and something I'm very sensitive to is smells. I tend to have reactions to any strong smell good or bad. Due to this I was unable to kiss him or have sex face to face or even just cuddle with his face too close to mine. Once he realised I was doing this he asked me why and I confessed I thought he had bad breath.\n\nHe said he brushes every day and flosses so it's not poor hygiene and decided to go to the dentist to double check. The dentist said his teeth and gums were healthy and she couldn't smell any bad breath from him leaving us all confused as to what it is that I am smelling.\n\nI feel horrible, it's been months and I still smell it when his face gets to close to mine, I try to pretend I don't because it clearly hurts his feeling but I do and it's impacted our ability to be intimate and do things like kiss.\n\nThe only logical conclusion I can come up with is that it's a figment of my imagination because I cannot think of anything else that would cause me to be smelling something nobody else can smell. This situation is clearly hurting his feelings I have no idea what to do, any advice would be appreciated.\n\nTLDR: I'm the only person who thinks my long term partner has bad breath including his dentist leading me to believe it's a figment of my imagination and it's lead to a lack of intimacy between us."

She constantly micromanaged my life during the time that I lived under my parents roof. I had to get straight A‚Äôs and turn in all of my assignments, or else I was met with screaming, berating, and the silent treatment for weeks at a time. She was my team mom for my 4 years of high school, despite me telling her that I thought it was negatively effecting our relationship.

                "body": "Hi friends, hope you are all well :)\n\nI, F(25), have been seeing this guy for the past 2 months (I said bf in the title but we aren't official yet). He's been to my place several times and each time he comes over he goes on and on about how I'm \"abusing\" my dog. \nBefore you jump to conclusions, he says this because I spoil my dog... A LOT. \n\nI adopted my baby, Cookie, from a local rescue shelter earlier this year, he was a very timid & scared puppy due to past neglect & abuse but when I met him, he crawled into my lap and fell asleep. I knew he was the one. Since then we have developed this wonderful bond, I can't even explain it. I love him so much.\n\nHere is a list of things I have done that this guy has classed as abuse: \n1. Due to past trauma, Cookie had a hairless patch on his tummy so I would put little dog sweaters on him so he wouldn't get cold. The patch grew back in full within weeks of coming home with me, but he still insists on wearing the jumpers. Truth be told, I think we both enjoy it. He has a whole collection of jumpers, hoodies, tshirts, bow ties, for some reason he just seems to enjoy it and I enjoy matching him with my outfits, he looks adorable. I am learning to knit and crochet so I can make him jumpers.\n2. Apparently Cookies night routine is \"abusive\", it consists of a bubble bath (with dog safe products only, and a lil bonnet on to protect his ears) , blow dry, massage, cuddles, and then most nights I will rock him to sleep in my arms. I know this sounds silly but, I don't care, if my baby wants to be rocked to sleep I'm going to rock my damn baby to sleep üòÇ\n3. I had a birthday party for Cookie, other dogs from the neighbourhood showed up, there were balloons, party hats, cake for the babies & the adults, giftbags of dog toys, etc. It was so much fun. According to him this is \"weird.\" Every holiday is a reason to celebrate with Cookie, for Christmas he's an elf and he gets his own Christmas dinner, for valentines day I bake him cupcakes, for Easter he's a bunny and I take him on an easter egg hunt, etc.\n4. When we are on a walk but he's feeling tired I'll put him in one of those dog carrier harnesses and carry him on my chest (he's very small). He is very attached to me and always wants to be around me or held (I work remotely so this is not a problem) so I'll put him in one of those baby wrap carrier things that you wrap around yourself with him on my chest, he will either sleep or just vibe with me. Apparently I'm \"spoiling him\" like, just let me love my son? üòÇ\n5. I commissioned an artist to paint cookie with a little suit & glasses on reading a newspaper, I will display it in my hallway when it arrives. Every few months I paint one of his little paws and do a paw print in my scrapbook which is full of photos of him on our many travels. \n\nThere are other things as well like how much money I spend on him, how much time I spend preparing his meals, etc. I would understand if he expressed it in a \"hey I'm feeling a bit neglected\" kind of way, if I was, for example, focused on my dog whilst we were supposed to be spending time together, but he says it's not that, it's that I treat my dog like a human baby and that's bizarre. I don't really understand this. Everyone who has ever seen me with my dog always mentions how happy and healthy Cookie looks, how obvious it is that we love eachother and that it's clear he is well taken care of.\n\nCookie was found in a bin, he was left there to die in the cold, now he's getting nightly spa treatments, holidays, gourmet meals and being loved how he deserves to be loved. I don't see anything wrong with this and the comments are annoying me, I've asked him to stop and he won't, just need a bit of guidance & advice on how to handle this?\n\nThank you in advance! \n\nTLDR: guy I'm seeing keeps criticizing how spoiled my dog is.\n\nEditted to add: I know that, unfortunately, Cookie cannot live forever, so I have decided that after his passing I will have his ashes turned into a beautiful stone on a ring I will always wear. I found several companies that offer this service. Apparently it's \"weird\" but I honestly think it's wonderful, and I will definitely go through with it. \nCookie has brought me more joy than I can put into words, the ring feels like a loving tribute in rememberance of my best friend.\n\nUPDATE: I dumped him (the guy not Cookie), I would rather be with someone who loves animals as much as I do and who respects the love I have for my pet :) thanks everyone!"

                "body": "Sorry for a long post in advance. Also I'm on my mobile. Also english is not my first language.\n\nSo. Me(F23) and Susan(F24) had been best friends for 10 years. During those 10 years there were moments where she was a shitty friend. For example, there has been a period  where she cut off contact with me for 3 months because she started hanging out with this wannabe elite group and I wasn't cool enough and my family didn't have enough money so they gave her an ultimatum - either me or them.  She chose them and after three months sent me a text as if nothing happened and we continued our friendship.  We briefly mentioned it a couple of times after but never REALLY talked about it, but she did say she was sorry and that she was stupid for losing me. Some people later told me that during that period she tried to hook up with almost every guy I mentioned was cute. I don't think that is true but I also never asked.That was high school. Other examples are that every time she would meet a new guy, she would forget that I existed. But I got used to it and I knew that she would come around after a couple of weeks. Also almost every time I would be happy because of something that happened to me or because of something I did, she wouldn't necessarily ruin it for me but I could tell she wasn't truly happy for me. On the other hand, I would always be happy for her, I considered her success my success. When I started dating my now ex boyfriend she would have these little comments about me being lucky I met him first and would go on little lunches just the two of them. After I told him that it bothered me he cut their contact to minimum. I didn't mention anything to her because I knew it would lead to her gaslighting me. My mother and some of my other close friends never liked her, but I would always have her back. Or would just stay quiet. She also had a weird competiton with my younger sister(F10) for my attention when the three of us would hang out at the park or at home. Another thing worth mentioning is that a couple of years ago she cheated on her then boyfriend whom I was friends with and left it up to me to tell him that. Then later got mad that I was sometimes still hanging out with him because he is her ex (tbf I met him when they started dating but we became good friends later) and would constanty tell me that she would never still be friends with my ex boyfriends, which wouldn't bother me btw unless they did something bad or wrong to me. The list goes on and on but 10 years of that can't be put in one post.\n\n\nI guess you are now wondering why was I ever even friends with her. The thing is, she is my soul sister. I have never laughed with someone as much as I have laughed with her. I knew that at every given moment I can be 110% myself in front of her in all the ways imaginable. She would always say out lound the things that I would think in my head but was nice enough not to say them out loud. She would have my back all the time. If someone ever said something bad about me behind my back she would get in a legitimate fight and would cut them off. We didn't have to talk to know what the other one was thinking and feeling. Also she is an extrovert and I am an introvert who has trouble making friends at first, I'm not good with new people. There were times when I was younger where I had trouble even paying for coffee by myself and things like that. She would alway help me, offer to do it for me and introduce me to new people she met wihout me ever asking. She was my best friend in the entire world. She would just get me and I would get her. After a while I didn't even think of her as my friend, she was my sister. If I ever needed her (during periods we were okay) at any time of day or night, she would be there and bring pizza or something. If you have ever had the bestest friend in the world, you will know what I am trying to describe. Also she comes from a broken home, I have perosnally been there to see how much her mom doesn't give a shit about her and her father doesn't live with them, fogets her birthday and they see each other only when he has to buy her new clothes or shoes or something. She's not good at communicating her feelings but she has often told me that she is very greatful for me, that she understands that she is a shitty person sometimes and that she realizes that not many people would forgive her for her behavior so many times like I did. \n\n\nNow, in April 2022 she started dating this guy and of course she forgot about me. But this was the first time I got mad and was hurt because I was going through something personal and I really needed her to be here for me. And I said fine, lets see how much time we will go without contact if I don't initiate one. And it has been 8 months. At first I was heartbroken. Sad. Angry. I missed her like crazy. I still do but it has gotten better, now it's just when I hear a song we used to sing or when I see something funny that was an inside joke. It felt like (and is still feeling) like I'm going through a break up. I tried to figure out if it was something I had done because at one point it was obvious that she does not want contact. In few moments of weakness I invited her for a cup of coffee and she either just never opened a message or there was one time she said yes and never showed up. The last time we saw each other was in the middle of May at a mutual friend's birthday, she came with the guy she's seeing and we had minimal conversation.\nAnd now, at the end of December I'm supposed to see her again, again at a mutual friend's. Honestly, I'm having mild panic attacks just at the thought of it but I also don't want not to go and see my other friends just because of her. I also didn't say anything about it to most of the people that are gonna be there. And in the last couple of weeks she started texting me again, it's just random memes or one word instagram story replies, but last week she invited me for coffee. I said I was busy but the truth is, I'm really scared that if we talk, that I will once again look past everything that she had done and forgive her (not forget though). I know I am weak for her, and some friends told me they always felt like we were some kind of a on again - off again toxic couple. \n\nPeople in my life get angry at me when I say I miss her because of the way she treated me but that's because they love me. I need some advice on what I should do and how I should act.\n\n\nTDLR: My ex best friend was a shitty friend and went no contact with me for 8 months wich really hurt me but now, just before we are supposed to see each other again, she's texting me again and wants to meet up."

(Context: I made it very clear before we even started going out that the one thing I could not get over was being lied to.) I got over it though, for her. At the time it was worth it because I understood where she was coming from. But over time this withholding of information just never stopped. I kept trying to get over it and move on and thus we got 2 years deep and very attached. I don‚Äôt know what to do. How do people get through this feeling? How do you get over it?

During that time, my wife left our home and stayed with her mom 2 states over. It was pretty much staying at a friend's empty house with our 2yo son and visiting the hospital every day. Our son stayed with her dad who was divorced from her mom many years ago while my wife was at the hospital.\n\nDuring all this, I had to stay home as we couldn't afford for me to take off work. My wife babysits for work 2-3 days a week...really just depending on what she feels like, so she was able to stop. We barely scrape by financially with that. And this lasted from mid-July to early September. In August I took the leave I had already scheduled for my birthday to go on a trip with friends and went to stay with her there for a week to support instead. In mid September, she came back because I had a week-long training in another state. When I got back, she left again, this time leaving our son with me for 2 weeks. I balanced caring for him while also working remotely during a high-demand period at my job. I did what was immediate and put the rest off best I could. When she finally came home, I worked late frequently trying to catch up at work. I'm a bit specialized and there's a good amount I can't hand off, even if someone else could, they wouldn't have the time. It's a pretty intense job.\n\nWe were all together at home for a week or so and her mom passed away. There's a lot of drama in between I missed between her step-dad being absolutely insufferable. He slandered my wife to the family and her mom didn't want to be around him. Part of the reason she stayed in the hospital. Her mom transferred herself to a 3rd state where her sister and my wife's sister live. And she died there a day before my wife's scheduled flight to go with our son. It was another 2 weeks until the funeral, and I flew out for 3 days over a weekend. \n\nWe still have only had one weekend where something hasn't been happening with my job or with other family passing through. I was gone all of last week on training. I stayed up from 7 am -10pm working everyday trying to catch up during training in the day. What isn't occupied, I have to spend working on our second car to keep it operable. We can't afford a shop to do it for us.\n\nWe're financially, mentally, emotionally, physically exhausted. \n\nI'm exhausted....I'm now still a month behind in my work, and entering the busiest time of year along with low staff and doing 3 people's worth of work. I have nothing left. I can't support any more and there's no one to support me. I'm alone without family on this side of the country. No friends as we've only lived here for 1.5 years. My wife and son are it.\n\nThrough all of this, my wife expressed she wanted someone to talk to, like a therapist. I did a lot of research trying to find someone and found several that could help, but she didn't want to make an appointment. I don't know what to do or how to support her. I can't handle it anymore.\n\nAs you can imagine, our sex life is non-existent. Honestly, it was never great to begin with. She's never been one to initiate sex and rejects me 9 times of 10. She thought scheduled sex would help. She said she's had trauma in the past with partners forcing her when she doesn't want to. I've never done that, ever. I hate the schedule. I'm not into it, and it makes me feel like she's just doing it to appease me as she does even less in bed. Our sex life has always been me giving to her, but now she doesn't want it, and she's not giving either. This isn't just her mom, it's been this way and getting worse since the start.\n\nIn the meantime she's always been disagreeable and admits she does it without realizing. Just saying the opposite to make an disagreement about little things all the time. She says it's about voicing an opinion, but it's really not, when it's about factual things or stupid little things. It's about saying something different than me. I usually let it go and let her have whatever she's saying...even if it's wrong and I know it. It's better than fighting about it. Right now I can't handle it. It's driving me nuts. \n\nAll along I want to support her because I know she's still in pain after only a month and a half since her mom died, but it's getting really difficult. I'm at the end of my rope and there's still noone there. I feel like she doesn't realize that this whole thing has affected me too. And I'm still paying for it."

My sister never had an issue with it and treated him as family. When I move back to my mom's home I spend most of my time at his place but only in his room never the common areas. I have a very controlling mother who has gone out of her way to sabotage my relationship because she always complains that she has no one so she makes things really difficult and my bf let's me crash at his place. He shares a place with his sister and now I believe she hates me now. He gets mad because he tries to appease her and when asked she says I didnt  do anything to anger her she just wants her space. Well, I have no issue with that however he mentioned this is what destroyed his previous relationship because the other gf actually helped them get that place and also lived there but the sister did the exact same things she is doing to me now. The same complaints his ex had are happening to me. Everytime Im over she closes her door and will barely acknowledge me. He wants his own place but he feels stuck. He is aware of her attitude. I try to stay to myself and his other family loves me but she seems really annoyed. I just went back home but now we can't see each other as much because my mom has been very demanding of my attention but he is able to visit just not spend the night. I respect that this is his sister's place as well however am feeling awkward because this happened to his ex many years ago as well. I hate that I was over so much, but he kept reassuring me that people don't know the circumstances of my mom and he is always going to let me be there. I have not been there since because I am fully aware what destroyed his last relationship and I don't want to repeat the same mistake. I get it's her place too but where do we go from here? I don't want to come between them so Ill just keep my distance from the home but I'll keep doing my best to not let that affect us."

                "body": "(will probably post on other subs too)\nsorry if it‚Äòs too long, but I really need advice.\n\nMy boyfriend (m18) and I(f18) are deeply in love with each other. He is the best boyfriend one could imagine. Since we got together a few months ago we have been hanging out 24/7- sleeping over at each other‚Äôs every night, spending every free minute together. I love him so deeply.\n\nHe has been severely mentally ill, but is a lot better now. He is often insecure and questions my love for him- but even that has gotten a lot better (happens less and less severe). Some of his mental struggles can be tracked back to his father leaving him at a young age and his family overall. \n\nHis family is my main concern. His mothers and older sisters behavior are (as I see it) emotionally abusive. They blow small things (forgetting to do laundry once) out of proportion and fight with him for hours over it- saying he doesn‚Äôt care about them because he forgot something. When he tries to reason with them, they twist the meaning of his words and make him out to be the asshole when they are just too self centered and stubborn to try to get his point. \nMy boyfriend often has panick attacks when arguing with them as they basically scream at him and tell him how egoistical he is for whatever he has done (most of the time it s something small he forgot or something he has no control over (being late because the train wasn‚Äôt on time etc))\n\nThey also used to humiliate him when he was in a state of panick and didn‚Äôt react to anything, to at least get some kind of reaction from him (slapping, insulting etc).\nWhen he has those panick attacks they generally keep on screaming at him and don‚Äôt seem to really care (they say he fakes them for manipulation, but he really does not)\n\nYesterday they had a fight again. His mother found out that he has been lying to her about going to the gym. He tried to explain her that he didn‚Äôt trust her enough to tell her that he felt awful going there, and that he was scared that she wouldn‚Äôt understand his reasoning and be mad about it. They argued for a pretty long time when his sister also started to fight with him- saying he has no respect at all and how awful of a human being he is. I was waiting in his room and heard them fight for at least 3hours no end. \n\nHe then had s huge panick attack again and I went down to them to try to calm him down and help him. I didn‚Äôt intend to intervene somehow- at the end of the day it s none of my business- I just wanted to calm my boyfriend down as he often wants me there when he has panick attacks. \nHis sister started to comment on me in a passive aggressive way saying to stay out of their business and how he doesn‚Äôt need me there etc. i tried to ignore her and just be there for him till he calmed down. \nShe said it was only okay for me to be there if I left after he calmed down so they could keep on ‚Äûtalking‚Äú. So that s what I had to do after.\n\nThey kept on arguing, and his mother joined back into the conversation. I heard how they screamed at him from both sides and it was so loud and everything. He had a panick attack again. I tried to go there to help him but they wouldn‚Äôt let me in, telling me that if he wanted to leave the situation that he was free to leave at all times (when he has panick attacks he can‚Äôt stand up or move). They belittled me saying the door is closed for a reason and to not always get into their business. \n\nI felt so helpless and didn‚Äôt know what to do.  I went to his room again and from there heard him crying and screaming. It hurt so much to hear all that. I myself had a panick attack because I was so worried and so hurt hearing him like that. I sadly relapsed (SH) that moment because I didn‚Äôt know how else to get the panick out of my head. \n\nHe came to the room a few minutes later. He seemed calm and told me that everything was fine and tried to soothe me (I didn‚Äôt tell him about my SH relapse). We fell asleep a little bit later (after 4hours of fighting)\n\nToday morning I woke up and felt weird. I was worried for my boyfriend and generally felt anxious in their house. I used to be okay with his mother and sister, but I m scared of them since today. \nI told him that I wanted to leave and go home as soon as possible and he said okay but that he wants to stay there a little bit longer. I couldn‚Äôt understand how he wanted to be there even longer than he had to. \n\nHe seemed weird so I asked if everything were okay and he said that he doesn‚Äôt get how I could hate his family that much. He told me that he s just okay with them and Is confused by my strong feelings against them (I have always hated them and he knows, not just because of yesterday- I never show them though). \nI was confused. I told him I don‚Äôt get how he can be okay with them even though they treat him like shit- they may buy him small things but most of the time they don‚Äôt really talk. I get that they did a lot for him (paid for his therapy and other stuff), but he is also so grateful that they let him live there, do some of his laundry, cook. And yes sure, they do that, but does that make a family a family- does so little make one love their family?\n\nHe said it s okay for me to go home and that he ll soon come too, he just wants to stay a bit. \n\nSo i left with mixed feelings.\nI told him that I was scared of his family. He knows how they treated me (he said they won‚Äôt treat me this badly from now on (he thinks!!)). And I just don‚Äôt know.\n\nI was so scared of the whole situation yesterday even though he says that it happens sometimes and is nothing new to worry about. I will still worry, and I will still be hurt when I hear his crying and screams of pain. And even though a situation like that one has happened before, it wasn‚Äôt as extreme. \n\nI don‚Äôt know how many times more I can hear his panick attacks and have a breakdown myself. It pained me so much I even relapsed after being fine for nearly half a year. I don‚Äôt know how much more often I can be there to reassure him that he ll be okay and that he ll be fine when he himself doesn‚Äôt seem to see how bad it is.\n\nIt is just so much and I don‚Äôt know how to handle it. I love him so very much- he is the love of my life. There is not one thing bad about him- he is the kindest, funniest, most caring, most lovable person ever. \nI don‚Äôt ever want to lose him.\nYet his situation at home is breaking me. I want to be there for him but I don‚Äôt know how much more I can take of this.\n\nWhat do I do? How should I feel about this?\nPlease somebody help"

Well it seems that I‚Äôm the only one who mops and vacuums the place. On both my days off I‚Äôll mop the entire house vacuum it and wash off the kitchen surfaces. We also have two puppies who obviously create a mess and I pick up after them more than she does. I‚Äôll come home from work and there will be poop and pee in the kitchen and she‚Äôs too busy smoking and watching tv to have noticed it. As well as when the pups destroy a toy they‚Äôll toss the stuffing everywhere and she won‚Äôt even bat an eye to it even if I‚Äôve just cleaned the floor. I‚Äôm the one who walks them more often because she claims they hurt her back as well as buys their food. I have to get up at 6 everyday even the days I barely slept to walk the pups cause their on a schedule and she refuses to do it. On Saturdays and Sundays I work and she‚Äôs off but I still have to be up mad early and she‚Äôll sleep for 12 hours. Balancing all this on top of getting ready for the state police academy drains me and I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt have a horrendous caffeine addiction at this point because of it. She notices how much caffeine I drink and says she‚Äôs worried about me and then asks why I drink all of it and why I‚Äôm so tired even tho she can pretty much see why I‚Äôm always tired. I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt want to walk my pups I‚Äôm just saying I‚Äôd like a little help and I‚Äôve voiced that to her but she gets offended and shuts down. Same thing goes for if I bring up how I cook food more often or door dash it more often. She states she doesn‚Äôt like cooking that much because it reminds her of growing up with her grandparents who I guess made her do it every Now and then as a chore. Im not saying she doesn‚Äôt do anything I‚Äôm just saying she doesn‚Äôt help out a lot of the time. Am I crazy?"

I was in the first year of uni when we met, we moved in together and bought a house about 3 years later. \n\nWe've generally been pretty good as young professionals and have generally had evenings and weekends together. 6 years in now I feel trapped and lonely. Partner is quitting job and focusing on starting his own business and I have been supportive of it since I myself love my job and am able to support our lifestyle by just working myself, but he is worried about not bringing enough money once his job ends and so is putting a lot of time into his business, which I try to understand but also he has time to play computer games and hang out with friends. \n\nI'm not the kind of person to talk about feelings (grew up in a homophobic East European family and country and parents never displayed love to each other lol) and I think things have been deteriorating since last year or even before. \nI only now realised as I had always loved Christmas and this year I'm just feeling lonely watching Xmas films myself and feeling very unhappy which is unlike me this time of year. \nI have tried to make myself busy with hobbies such as making candles, working out etc. Yesterday I went out with a friend and had probably too many dreams. We've always been innocently flirting and didn't think much of it as I'm generally low-key flirty.

I would then maintain this while getting her to her destination as best I could & praying it'd happen sooner than later. The result of this was that all our sex felt like a challenge to me (She's there aiming to have the best time she can, I'm trying to put in a performance).\n\nSince I'm fitness minded I decided to apply some self improvement on the mental side to control my excitement & for a few weeks it was the best sex we've ever had. I could simply hold my excitement at wherever I wanted, then finish whenever I desired. It honestly felt like a super power.\n\nHowever now I've gone too far. She finishes & I'm barely 50% of the way there with no control to finish when I want. My partner is also a \"one & done\" type of girl when it comes to orgasms in sex, to the point where if we try to go much longer after she finishes she says she gets too sore & a second orgasm is very very rare. She says this is because I'm on the \"larger side\" and she just can't take it that much, as when she masturbates she's able to have \"more but less intense orgasms\" using her hands. (Backhanded compliments championship contender 2022?)\n\nI think because we've had a few experiences where she's had to throw in the white flag after she's finished it's made the experience even worse as now EVERY time we start to get down there is an anxious cloud over how it will end. I've tried to be polite & I say it's fine but it is really frustrating me now. \n\nHas anyone had similar experience? I know this post sounds like a ridiculous problem (help I literally can't stop out-sexing my partner) but it has ruined sex for me. I thought I was missing out on fun when I struggled to last but it turns out the grass isn't greener over the fence.\n\nIs this the \"sexual compatibility\" problem I see mentioned here often? I keep wondering if we're not such a good match anymore as a result of this.\n\n(Secondary account because I don't need her seeing this written down...)"

He never raised his voice or behaved in any abusive manner he just needed alcohol to function. \n\n\nI gave him two options sobriety or seperate, he chose sobriety and for 23 months has been sober and still attending meeting etc. I cannot fault his recovery. \n\n\nThe issue causing me to end the relationship is who he has become since his sobriety. He is a socai recluse, he has no desire to leave the house and when we do he finds any reason to get home. He always sees everything in a negative  worse case scenario light, which puts me off wanting to do anything.\nI believe this is due to mental health illness but he wont go to the GP. \n\nI don't want life to pass me by and he is holding me back but he is the best person i have ever had in my life but he is a carbon copy of how my dad was throughout my childhood. Although my dad never achieved sobriety and ended up spiralling and i have been NC for 20 years. \n\nI have asked him to move out and he has agreed but i am heartbroken for doing what i believe is the right thing. I am not an overly emotional person but this has opened the flodgates."

                "body": "I *\\[31F\\]* have a friend, Jake *\\[29M\\]* who I met almost 10 years ago through a mutual friend. This wil be long, unfortunately. **TLDR at the bottom.** Thanks for reading <3\n\nWhen I met Jake, we were both single, I had just gotten out of a very toxic relationship and was only looking for casual fun (you know the drill). We had sex once and made plans to meet again in the future, and meanwhile he had introduced me to this group of guys/friends that played the same online game I played, so we started all playing together. \n\nI'd spend so much time Skyping him, we were young and had so much time anyway. I liked him already, but as much as you can like some one you don't really know, after you've just exited a 2-year-nightmare.  He was also sort of seeing a girl, Sandy *\\[28F\\]*, and I very strongly remember him telling me he was not really into her etc.\n\nI'd also Skype with another guy from the gaming group, Alex *\\[31M\\]*, who soon asked Jake if there was something going on between us and if it'd be ok to persue something with me and Jake said 'go ahead'.\n\nI ended up dating Alex for about 8 years, only breaking up in Dec 2021. Jake is still dating Sandy.\n\nDuring all this time we were each dating our SOs, we didn't really remain friends. I remember in the begining, I tried being his friend like we used to be, but he wasn't really trying back so we fizzled out, went on with our lives and our new relationships and we'd only casually play the game with the group.\n\nWhen I broke up with Alex, we tried remaining civil and friendly, so when we'd plan meetups with the guys from the group, we'd both attend and everything was fine. Until it wasn't, obviously. Alex asked for some time complete No Contact with me, so I just backed off from everything, I let him have all the mutual friends and hobbies etc.\n\nOne day, Jake dms me to ask if I'm available for a meetup on a Friday. I tell him what's up with Alex, so they should just make plans among themselves for now and maybe I'll be joining in the future when Alex was over it. He said it won't be fun without me, I said sorry and that we could at least play the game sometimes so we'd hang like that. So we start casually talking a bit more, until one day he comes over my house to drop off something I asked for, and we ended up chilling for \\~7 hours, just talking. That day, he said he was planing on taking it to the next level with Sandy, probably within the next couple of years. \n\nAfter that, we began talking increasingly over the next few weeks. I introduced him to my best friend, Emma *\\[30F\\]*, who instantly liked him (she mentioned he was very good looking, that's all she said to me) and I would talk with him almost every night until morning. I later found out that most of those nights, he would leave Sandy to sleep and chill/talk with me. There was an undenyable chemistry between us, and a sexual tension (we talked about sexual stuff a lot, just conversation though, no phone sex or anything like that). He gradually started saying he had *doubts* about Sandy, that he doesn't feel like he wants to be with her anymore. Emma commented once or twice that it's weird too, but that's all.\n\nNow, I have some mild AuDHD and I know it's not an excuse, it just takes me some time to process things and realize what's going on. I'm also used to having guy friends and talking about all sorts of stuff, so it took me some time to realize that what's happening between us is not normal. I brought it up once, saying it's weird he talks to me for hours while he doesn't want to spend any time with Sandy. I also started to *suspect* I had a crush on him, but I didn't know what to do about it, I couldn't tell anybody either (he had a GF, I mean, I was ashamed..)\n\nTowards the end of summer, Emma and I threw a party. It was great at first, I had invited Jake too with a couple of his friends, we had a nice time. At some point, a guest made me extremely uncomfortable and I wanted to step out for a minute. Long story short, Jake came with me and we ended up sitting out for 2 hours talking. Well.. he also made sort of a move on me, telling me he'd be breaking up with Sandy the next day when I was like \"wtf u doin\". He repeated this many times, we were drunk/high enough and I didn't really need much to just let go.\n\nWe missed the end of the party, ended up at my place having sex *(fun fact- we never kissed)*. Horrible, I know, I am super ashamed and I've hated myself for a while now because of that. Next day, we sobered up and he realized he'd have to live with the *consequences* now. Would you look at that! We decided to cool it. Of course he didn't break up with Sandy.\n\nThe worst part for me at the time wasn't Jake/Sandy, it was *Emma*. She completly dropped me. We had been friends for *16 years* at that point, and she just.. dropped me. She thought I left the party with Jake to make her mad, or jealous, or something insane like that, she thought it was somehow about her, and no matter what I said she had made up her mind. It was the worst breakup of my life, especially because she wasn't clear with me, I had to just try and try and try to talk, to make up, to fix it, until I just gave up because she didn't care anymore but just wouldn't be straight with me.\n\nJake and I started talking again and hanging out again. We never talked about that night or anything between us ever again, and it was really helpful to have him as a friend during the Emma breakup. It's now been 3 months that we've been hanging **A LOT**. (He almost broke up with Sandy twice during that time, btw, but the key word here is -almost-.)\n\nBut last month I realized (late, again) that I have a damn crush on him. Then I also realized it's even more than that and I can't be friends with him, I need some time to process it, get over it and move on before we could be friends again, so I let him know.\n\nI get my shit together and we start hanging out again. Then he tells me he's into me too. It destroys all the work I put into dissociating and compartmentalizing. He says he's in a position where he must **pick between** ***me*** **and** ***Sandy***. He said that after hanging out with me, he went from 'ring shopping' to 'how to break up'. He referred to what we have as \"*platonic*\" and even admitted it was sort of an *emotional affair* (it's all obvious now to me, but it wasn't then, if that makes sense? maybe I was just in denial, idk).\n\nAgain, I said that we should take some time apart because this won't end well and I value our friendship so so much, I wouldn't want to risk it. He said it'd make him sad to not have me in his life, and asked if I could give him some time to think. That \"some time\" would be *pretending nothing is going on and keep chilling like we used to*. I was like F it, fine, I don't want to stop hanging out with him either, it wasn't a hard decision.\n\nBut it's a hard process for me now. Now that he told me he likes me, now that he said he had to \"*pick*\" essentially, I just can't stop thinking about it all. He gave me '*hope*' and now it's so much harder. I know deep down he won't leave Sandy, I know I'm just probably wasting my time, but I haven't felt like that since forever and I struggle to let it go. I need to be prepared for when the rejection comes, I just can't. \n\nI don't even know what to do. Should I just quit it with him? I *agreed* to take some time, I can't just take that back. Tonight we're going to a party together, Emma will be there too. I had invited Jake a week ago, he said he'd come, then when I didn't mention it again until 2 days ago, he said he thought I would go solo and said maybe it's better that way because if I were with him, it'd be harder to \"*meet guys*\". Like telling me I should ***NOT*** wait for him, but he literally asked me to wait... I'm so confused.\n\nI've only told a couple of friends, a married couple, but they love me and they see how stuck I am, so I don't think they're giving it to me straight. They said they believe he said that about the party to see how I'd react (I told Jake I invited him as a friend, not as a date, and I'll do whatever I want to do **IF** I wanted to do it).\n\nReddit, what do I do? He's the best friend I've had, but I'm also in love with him. How do I salvage this? Am I setting myself up for failure/hurt here? I usually build such strong walls to protect myself, but now I'm lost. I hate the role I've assumed, I hate being \"*the other woman*\". I even criticized a friend heavily for having an affair with a guy, and now here I am, an entire hypocrite writing a bunch of stupid words for a stupid problem that **I created**. \n\nIt's all so effed up. I'm so sorry for Sandy, I'm so sorry for Alex  and I'm so embarassed with myself, I wanted to be a good person, not some one who causes problems. I miss Emma, and I already miss Jake, or more accurately, I miss what I would like to have with him. I've never felt that way.\n\nLeave or wait? Can we be friends again after all that? Has anyone been through anything similar?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR** \\- I'm crushing hard on my buddy, he has a GF. He told me he likes me too, but he needs time to sort it out. I'm trying to distance myself but, for the life of me, can't. I value our friendship very much, how can I salvage it?"

I still have feelings and I‚Äôm not sure where to go. This person was my first boyfriend so it hurts a little more. \n\nLast Friday my boyfriend moved out from our out of town apartment complex, we didn‚Äôt live together but he did live with a close friend, he didn‚Äôt let either of us know. When we asked why he did it he only replied with something along the lines of ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt like it here‚Äù which is fine of course but he could‚Äôve just told us. I knew he wasn‚Äôt happy because he worked over night and slept all day so he didn‚Äôt have much of an opportunity to do anything else. Not to mention how expensive it was to live there. \n\nFlash forward to Tuesday, he drives over to my house, I‚Äôm in town already for the holidays lol, he tells me he doesn‚Äôt love me anymore and that he just doesn‚Äôt have feelings anymore. He said he wanted to be alone. When I asked him  since when, he replied with since mid October. But when I asked him if the past weeks mean anything to him he replied with, they did. We talked for about 2 maybe 3 hours which after a while he said I love you, saying he did have feelings, and hugged me and held my hand and cried, Etc. He promised me he wasn‚Äôt going to replace me, and that he was going to visit me when he was ready but I‚Äôm not even sure if to believe those promises. He told me he was going to miss me and that he knew what he was losing. After we were done talking he walked me to my door hugged me kissed me and that was that. I haven‚Äôt seen him since. \n\nThe reason he wanted to break up was in his words\n1. He felt like he wasn‚Äôt good for me because he hadn‚Äôt accomplished anything.\n2. He felt like he wasn‚Äôt his own person.\n\nI tried talking him into just a break but he was very hard on just breaking up.\n\n\nI‚Äôve been texting him a couple times a day reminding him that I love him and that I‚Äôm here for him when he‚Äôs ready but I get very static responses such as just hearting my messages and sending ‚Äúgoodnight üíú‚Äù after I say  ‚Äúgoodnight.‚Äù It made me feel a little better even with those responses, but yesterday I sent him similar messages and got no response. Im not sure if it was because he was tired from his old-new job, but he was playing video games with friends last night so I‚Äôm going to take a guess he‚Äôs probs avoiding me :((. purposely even left our friend group chat so he could talk to them without me interfering.  At one point I asked him if he ment everything he said during our talk and he said ‚Äúcan we talk about it another time‚Äù which only made me more worried, I‚Äôm wondering did he lie to me‚Ä¶.I‚Äôm not even going to lie, him not opening up my messages yesterday made me really sad. Not sure if he is ignoring me because I‚Äôm the only one being pushed away, he‚Äôs still fine with our friends.. \n\nWhile yes I want him to find himself and accomplish what ever it is he wants, I am terrified of him loosing all feelings for me. I‚Äôm afraid if I cut off all contact he won‚Äôt come back in the future. I really miss him and everyday it gets harder, yet I feel like it‚Äôs easier for him. He told me it wasn‚Äôt my fault yet somehow I feel like it was. I know everything makes me sound clingy, but after four years of it being us, how could I not. I really miss him and I want us to get back together eventually one day but Any advice?"

She seems to like the exchange because I don't last long at all so it's like 5 minutes of work for 20 minutes of work. My question is if this is normal behavior for a couple?

Of course, google says guys do this when they're \"catching feelings\" or \"miss\" the woman lol\n\nOnly reason I'm asking is because I saw this guy recently and the sex was amazing. We saw each other 3 times but things started to get awkward because he would ask me if I was enjoying it, doubted his size, saying he wished his muscles were bigger, etc. Then he started saying I was always in my head about things but I never said anything to him like that lol. Anyway, he moved back to his home state and completely blocked me. He said he would be back but that was probably a lie and I really liked him. Any chance that he'll contact me again? Probably a long shot but figured I would ask anyway \n\nTL;DR: I caught feelings for my FWB and wondering if guys ever feel the same in these type of relationships or is it usually one-sided. I miss him but I just want to get over these feelings since he more than likely doesn't feel the same"

A male college of mine, the girl and myself. \n\nMale college is married and 50 years old. Girl has a boyfriend and is 30, I am 32. \n\nI started to notice that they were always kind of touching each other and having whispered conversations. The girl booked all the flights and the hotels, they were late arriving at check-in and before they got there. She asked me what floor i was on(which was 1), then the next morning i noticed they were both on two. I had a suspicion that they were staying in each others rooms because they never wanted me on their floor, they always went up to their floor together and came back down together.\n\nOn lots of occasions when we were out at bars after work, i would walk away and if i turned round, they guy would start putting his arm around her. One thing is, the guy is very handsy when he is drinking. But last night i left our table to go to the bathroom. I went the wrong way and had to turn back. When i turned around he had his arm around her shoulder and was leaning into her. She noticed me coming back and she threw his arm off, almost like \"We can't let him see\"\n\nAnyway, they both noticed i was acting weird. Because i had lots of suspicions and i was crushing hard on her, so i was feeling sick and could barley look her in the eye. \n\nSo i just straight up asked them if there was anything going between them. They both denied it and just said they were very close because they had been traveling together for work.\n\nAnyway. In my head no, i am convinced that every night when they were going back up to their floor, they were fooling around with each other. Or having a full affair. So I'm wondering, could i be imagining all of this? I'm literally love sick with her, all of a sudden my appetite disappeared, dry mouth, sore stomach, the whole thing. Could my current state of mind be messing with me? \n\nI'm literally sitting thinking about every interaction they had and everything that happened over the past week, to figure out if something is going on, it's driving me insane."

He was on a business trip and 7 year old me miss him. I called his accommodation number (no mobile phone back then), and a woman answered. The call abruptly ended, and when I called again, I ask who was that woman; my dad denied any woman. It didn't come much later that we found out he had an affair. This cause massive damage, but especially to my mother, who supported both him and his children through hard times, such as when he lost his jobs and refuses to work, so mom was the sole breadwinner for a time. They stayed together in the end (not sure why; Love? Shame? I was too scarred to ask). While he did finally pull himself together (mom actually left her job as she was sick of him refusing to look for one), he continues to pay more attention to other people rather than his own family; he will always help others and look after them, yet he left his own children to their own devices and siphon money from my mom (and later me) when his job didn't pay much yet his expenses and debt keep increasing. My mom found out one of the reason why he keeps lacking money is because he keep giving it away to other woman to help them, whatever it was, even though bills were mostly paid by mom (with me also contributing once I started working).\n\nBack to current; my brother is following our late father's footsteps, only this time it is worst;\n\n1. He's going for marriage while our late father (allegedly) didn't\n2. M is a SAHM, so she isn't financially independent, unlike my mom\n\nNow, my religion may allow man to have more than 1 partner, and I have no problem with this because I believe it is a woman's right to marry a man who can provide for her, even if the man is already married, provided the following criteria is met;\n\n1. The man is fully able to provide for his current family, and him marrying another will not jeopardize the current's family situation (e.g. they can continue to live as they are, with no reduction to comforts etc.)\n2. The man is able to be fair to his family (wife and children)\n3. The man receive permission and blessing from the current wife\n\nI find K sorely lacking in all these areas;\n\n1. His current family isn't poor, but clearly could benefit with more money (for foods, bills, maintenance, and maybe a new computer for the kids). He has been giving AP and her parents money, **whereas our own mother doesn't get any**. K also have struggling  younger siblings, whom he could helped (instead, me and our mom helped pay for their food).\n2. He left M and the kids to be with AP and turn off his phone. One night, middle kid had trouble breathing. M tried to contact him but couldn't get through, so she woke the eldest to look after the youngest at the dead of night looking for any clinic that was open. He choose secrecy and leaving it to M to take care of **his kids** in case of emergency.\n3. Of course M refuses to give permission, so AP told her that they will elope to the neighboring country to get married (common for couples to do when the 1st wife doesn't give permission)\n\nI am seething mad because 1st it was my mother, now my own brother does it to another. M doesn't deserve this. She is sweet, nice and kind. She is a much better daughter compared to me to my mom (no hate from me, because she is a good person). The reason she is a SAHM mom was because when their first kid was born, both of them were working, so they needed to find a babysitter. Being first time parents, they were warry of leaving their child to strangers, so they asked my mom's maid to take care of their child (my parents were still working and me & the other siblings were studying, so no one was at home during the day). Not sure how much they paid her (or if she was paid at all), but it went on till the maid's contract ended. They couldn't find anyone, so in the end, M decided to quit her job and become a full time SAHM. They went off to have 2 more kids.\n\nCurrently, K is overseas in another country due to work, which will go on for few years. He was supposed to come back in February for a break, but told M that he won't be back. She suspect he's going to get married with AP during that time. M have been finding red flags here and there before (such as tissues with kiss mark, unknown hotel credit card charges), but K always denies it, saying it was his friends and such. Now that her world is crashing down, me, my mom and other siblings doesn't know how to help M and the kids. We worry that K might do the unthinkable and abandon both M and the kids. It's why we don't dare to confront him right now. M doesn't have much savings. My mom is retired and her savings are dwindling (remember I have siblings who are struggling? Well they're pretty much rely on her). As for me, I don't earn much and could at most support myself and my mom. K is still paying for the house M and the kids live in. The youngest kid is starting school next year. There's 3 kids. How can a single mother who left the workforce for so long be able to provide for them?\n\nI'm scarred. And also sad. For M and the kids. I'm tearing up cause it reminded me of so much of the pain we had to go through when my late dad's affair was revealed. He went for a woman in her 20s, and AP is around the same age too. I want to help M and the kids. I love the kids. The oldest will be devastated, while the other 2 is too young. If they have to move out, I will let them live in my house, but I don't know if M will take it, as it's near their current home. Other than that, I don't know what else I can do to help them. I'm lost and a messed right now but M is surely having it worst. What can I do to help? How can I convince my brother to not do this to his own wife and kids?"

I was enjoying this side of my life and amidst it all, I met my partner, who is absolutely amazing\n\nNow, the main part..\n\nNearly 4 years ago during our courting, I told her in the long term I can‚Äôt do monogamy - I personally find it suffocating, was enjoying a varied sex life and if not accepted, I would likely eventually cheat. She agreed it‚Äôs something she‚Äôd be open to down the road.\n\n3 years later (12 months ago) she started being interested in us swinging with other couples after we‚Äôd come to admit to each other we both enjoyed porn involving groups (yay!), but the interest died down on her side (her jealousy issues awoke). I told her I love her greatly, but this relationship isn‚Äôt for me, she broke down crying saying she‚Äôll give me threesomes. She never did follow through, nor mention it again\n\nIn the lead up to a big overseas trip recently, she was talking up about finally trying swinging out while we could be away, free and anonymous in foreign lands. The trip lasted 2 months and nothing happened or was mentioned by her. With 2 weeks remaining on the trip, I raised it and she shrugged it off mentioning I didn‚Äôt raise it either (seeing as though the jealousy issues are on her side, I felt best to not be the one to keep raising the matter).\n\nNow over the last few days she‚Äôs talking about how she‚Äôd like to fall pregnant in the next 18 months (we previously agreed to one kid, now she‚Äôs suggested we have two). She mentioned we wouldn‚Äôt be swinging while we had a family (which I didn‚Äôt really enjoy hearing), so I feel like my window is an unlikely best case of 18 months and a worst (and feeling most likely) case = not at all\n\nAs she‚Äôs always the one who being waited on, I‚Äôm awaiting her to confirm when she‚Äôs comfortable to proceed, so I‚Äôm not raising the topic out of fear of being a pest on a sensitive subject. But I‚Äôm starting to think she‚Äôs just stringing me along.\n\nPlease feel free to share any thoughts"

We eventually got our own place through the council this time last year and I thought it would be magical, turns out to be quite the opposite, still arguing and now the added pressure of bills due to one income coming in while she looks after our son.\n\nOur arguments continue, she rejects all help from me and when I don't help she has a right go at me, swearing etc, some of this happens in front of our son aswell, some days I just want to walk but am worried of the consequences like not seeing my boy everyday, having to pay child support (which I would pay) just so he doesn't have to see us argue in front of him, no doubt that her family will be after me aswell especially her mum, packing all my stuff, swapping over the direct debits as i pay the rent, energy, water etc. I ask to chat about our relationship when things have calmed down after an argument and she declines to chat and that there's nothing to talk about, I sometimes dread coming home after work and being anxious about the next fight and I also dread the weekends aswell.\n\nI feel like I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't, what also doesn't help me is that my dad left me when I was 2 years old due to other reasons though, he got addicted to drugs and got kicked out by my mum and I never saw him again, I will feel like a failure if I repeat this and I think if I were to ask to see my boy at the weekends I would get rejected.\n\nNobody knows about these in depth details, friends, family, work colleagues, the lot, i feel like everything is my fault, i do bite back when she starts on me and i appareciate looking after our baby all day is hard work, even i struggle at the weekends due to the working week 8 till 6.\n\nI apologise for the amount of text, has anyone got advice and have you been in a similar experience?"

He is from a different city, but he goes to uni in my hometown, so he spends most of his time here, and only goes home from 3-5 days a month and a half or so. Now for the new year's we would like to go to his home town and spend it with his friend group and also meet his family. My parents like him a lot and are cool with me going there, but they want me to stay at a hotel/airbnb. They said that it is disrespectful to his parents if I slept at his house, in his bed, especially since is the first time meeting them. I kind of see where they are coming from (cuz it's the first time meeting them), but I think it's weird to sleep at a hotel or book an airbnb. What bothers me the most is that they said I have no self respect for thinking this way, and that they only understand how parents think and they won't like me if I will sleep in their son's bed. I told my bf that I was going to get a hotel room or something to not bother his family and he thought I was kidding, like it made no sense to him to go somewhere else and insisted on me staying with him. Is it actually disrespectful for me to do this or are my parents just shaming me for nothing?"

He‚Äôs on the right-leaning side of the scale and whereas I‚Äôm on the more left-leaning side of things. It‚Äôs not really that, that bothers me. It‚Äôs the fact that in every social situation he has to bring up politics. His friends are the same way. Literally the first time I met his best friend of 20+ years, the guy asked me my thoughts on Trump as a first question.

                "body": "I(21F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for quite a while now. We are stable and often talk of a future together.\n\nI study film and media full time and will be graduating in six months. I also have a day job that from which I help with some of my little sister's school expenses. I'm trying to save up to buy an expensive video camera that I've been dreaming of forever. Here's the thing, I go to college almost 2.5 hours away from where I live. It's close to where my boyfriend lives. It's exhausting to travel 5 hours almost daily but I make it work. My boyfriend strongly suggests I move out somewhere closer to college and to him so things will be easier for me. At first, I loved the idea but soon I realised that it's going to be really expensive with the rent and maintenance and other bills. I share these expenses with my mom at home. Things are slightly tight for us financially. My mom is a single mom and has been the only breadwinner for our family both before and after my dad passed. So this set-up works for us.\n\nI told my boyfriend I wont be able to move out very soon, stating it's difficult and moving out will leave no scope for me to save up for the camera or have any emergency savings either. He said it's okay if i don't want to, but still often talks about how far away I live and how unsafe it is. I'm the one that mostly travels up to see him. In a recent casual discussion on the subject, I told him that I might be able to move once I graduate, get a raise, and buy the camera I've been wanting to. Then I asked him if he would move with me at any point. He ignored the question. I asked again and he said I can live with him and his parents. I told him I can do that for maybe a couple weeks but I want to have my own home. No hard feelings for parents at all.  Im Indian so women living with their partner's parents is like a old custom here although it's almost obsolete these days. I think I'm young, as is he, and we both have a long way to go. But it's kind of concerning to me that he thinks this way. \n\nI also noticed that he is really dependant on his parents. He asks permission for almost everything. He hides our relationship from them and it's not like we just started dating. It's been over a year. He's financially dependant on them currently but he says it won't be so for very long.  I don't really mind any of this for most parts. I offer to help him as much as I can and he always supports me in my efforts too and I'm really grateful for that. But this particular discussion has worried me quite a bit. I've had super toxic relationships in the past. I suffer from a crippling amount of anxiety and I'm not sure if I'm overthinking this but I don't want to be in a relationship when there's probably already a dealbreaker. But I also feel like I'm thinking this way too much. I respect his choices and in no capacity do I want him to change his plans for me. But I can't help feeling like if I'm only postponing a breakup over this? \n\nEdit: In a recent text, he wrote that he doesn't want to dump his parents after they've helped him so much. Personally, I don't believe that moving out is 'dumping' parents. He also says that he thinks I resent him for not having a job, which I don't. I did find him a work from home job earlier this year but I also ended up doing most of the work for him. It got stressful with my own job and school so I stopped helping and he was fired soon after. Since then, I have offered to pay for everything whenever we are spending time together. I have no problem doing this. However, I feel like none of this matters in the end. I don't want him to choose but I'm conflicted about what here is the right thing for me to do."

She recently thanked me for being able to cheer her up even in her darkest moments. The more time I spend with her the more my feelings grow. She texts me regularly outside of work with all kinds of stuff. Funny stuff, personal stuff... it's a really open exchange.\n\nTrouble is, she's in a relationship. When we first met she was in a different relationship but that ended pretty badly and she quickly ended up in a new relationship. She seems happy even though she \\*did\\* complain about her new partner at times. On other days she tells me she \"lucked out with him\". So I'm getting somewhat mixed signals. But every relationship has ups and downs so I this is not surprising.\n\nI've been contemplating telling her how I feel. But we're working together.... closely. And that could be awkward for all kinds of reasons. No matter how that would go. I feel trapped. I have confidence that I can live with the current situation though. And just \"suck it up\".\n\nOur company has a small psych/social-department at work who are there for these kinds of questions. I am reluctant to turn on them though because - even though there's confidentiality (the office is not even located at the headquarters) - I'm worried that this could make social events of the company awkward if I run into those guys while having her stand next to me at the same social event.\n\nAnother detail that adds to my predicament is the \"having kids\" question. I've not been super lucky with my past relationships because I'm not keen on having kids. And for my previous partners I've had this was a deal-breaker. A couple of weeks ago, we were having an after-office drink with a couple of co-workers and she was there too. During a discussion she let it slip that she also does not want any kids. I probably read too much into that. But she knows that I don't want any kids and now I'm not sure if she made that comment to let me know or if that was just part of the conversation without any afterthought.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?"

Staying and committing to one person has always been my ideal. But now I'm feeling different.\n\nI've never been a popular person. No one was ever interested in me in school and I never dated anyone. Most of the time, I was the quiet kid, a people pleaser. Every day I dreamed about my prince right. I wanted to meet him in school, face to face. He would be my only one and I would marry him and get through life together, raising children. Years passed by, I never dated, kissed or hugged anyone.\n\nAlmost 4,5 years ago, I went to university. I was really insecure. A miracle happened, I met this guy and he was genuinely interested in me. We started dating and it was a complete new world to me. He was so kind and we shared similar experiences. We wanted same things in life, a peaceful life with kids. Only 7 months after starting uni, we moved in together. It happened very fast. It felt strange, but deep inside I was happy. Dreams can really come true, I thought. We still live together. We've had our really bad days, but life is going okay.\n\nThis year has been a rollercoaster. Lots of shitty things have happened to me. I've definitely grown stronger and gained more confidence because those things happened. And I have finally found my dream career path and passion in life. At the same time, I've started to question my first and only relationship. Our life together is nice, but something feels off. Sometimes I feel, that I get nothing from the relationship (except intimacy, support etc...). My partner is really passionate about his hobbies and talks about them all the time. I've participated in his hobbies, but they are just not my cup of tea. I would like to have a hobby together, but he is not really exited about that idea and it makes me sad. I support him and listen his hobby ramblings. If I say something negative about his hobbies, he gets defensive; \"Why are you dating me then??\" I have this lonely and hollow feeling. How can I feel lonely in a relationship? We have sex, we hug and kiss. We laugh together. He says he loves me so much. He boasts about me to his relatives, that I'm so kind and supportive, best girl ever. I've made him happy. Almost every single day he talks about our future kids. Recently I have been wanting more alone time. Sometimes I think that I would be happier alone. Everything looks perfect outside, but a part of me is not happy. Have I grown apart from my partner? What is this feeling of wanting more?\n\nI feel guilty and confused, because I have these odd feelings. Why would I leave this kind man, who shares the same future goals with me?

I want nothing more than to rebuild our marriage, I have done absolutely everything within my power to prove that I am sorry and that I am 100% dedicated to us, our family, and our relationship. I knew the no sex was going to be a hard barrier for me, but it‚Äôs gotten to the point where the denials are getting to my head. She has ALWAYS said porn is cheating, so she supplied me with sexy pictures of her to masturbate to, but every time I consider doing it, it feels wrong because I‚Äôve never had to do it with her pictures and anything else was always said to be cheating. Now, my love language is intimacy, so everything about this entire situation keeps making me feel like she doesn‚Äôt love me anymore, or that she‚Äôs seeing/talking to someone else, and it‚Äôs driving me absolutely insane. Every time I hint at it and she denies, it feels like a gut punch, because it‚Äôs never just ‚Äúno‚Äù, it feels more like she‚Äôs embarrassed to flat out say no so she just gives me other solutions or has no reaction at all. Am I just being over dramatic because of the lack of intimacy or has our flame been smothered?"

He snd I had both broken up with out ex partners around 3 months ago. Him and his exe were pretty close friends in addition to their secual/romantic relationship but his ex is pretty emotionally unstable (very depressed/anxious, etc.). His exe insists they have phone calls every week and he texts her every morning asking how she slept. He said that his relationship to her is very important to him snd he doesn't have a lot of other close friendships so he'd like to keep this one going. I told him it made me very uncomfortable and that calls every week (1-2hours long) and texts everyday was too much. He told me it should matter to me because it was important and mattered to him. I feel pretty disrespected and my rewuest that they slowly cut ties was completely rejected."

My bf is a very empathetic, eccentric individual and I could not ask for a better bf. My two friends(21F, 22F) come in the picture. We were having a small get together and just having a couple drinks. My friends are known for their sarcasm and dark humor but things took another line. I am also on the receiving end of their friendly roasting but I think they do not like my boyfriend and are trying to drive a fork within our relationship. My bf is a silly person and he cracks goofy and sometimes awkward jokes but he doesn‚Äôt do anything harmful. My friends made some satirical comments before and he found it as part of their personality. Last night, my bf got hurt by them. He tried to match their levels of satirical comments but they started taking offense. Some comments he made were ‚Äúyou have to be a party popper don‚Äôt you?‚Äù, he told his his friends that my two friends were haters in a satirical way too. My friends were boiling. At some point my friends made all men are trash jokes but my bf overheard and said to one of my friends to not judge all off them by a few based off my friends breakup and that it is unfair to generalize. Both of my friends went off on him saying it was personal and if he was too dumb to tell they don‚Äôt vibe with him and to get lost. He tried apologizing and he said he didn‚Äôt know the context because my friends are known for their dark humor and sardonic attitudes. My friends told my bf he lacked self awareness and he is a weirdo and that I can do better. My bf left the area and I was furious. I asked for some space and I went with him to a private room where he started breaking down saying he thought it was alright based on their demeanors. He felt really lead on and then dumped on. I get if people don‚Äôt mesh but my friends have been like that to my bf for sometime and now I think it was pretty serious. I got furious and told them i am done for the night and to apologize because they had no business being in my relationship. My friend said you can get a more self aware boyfriend and I said they viewed him as problematic which is not an issue but I am furious they will talk down on him. They also said that our friendship was way longer and if I would ruin it over him so I have to be careful when talking to them. Even since I started dating him, they were making comments to me. I also said they can make stuff clear from the get go. My boyfriend is quirky but he is really communicative and he acts upon advice. It is not like he carries himself bad but my friends behaviors pissed me off and I really don‚Äôt want to talk to them until they apologize. My friends are texting me now saying I made a big deal of everything and I am too sensitive. They are my best friends from high school but I am thinking about cutting them off without an apology, it hurts but my bf said he had trust issues for this very reason."

I used to do a lot of hallucinogenic drugs, I have had threesomes before, etc., but now I am sober and monogamous. \n\nSo last night I was at a concert with my boyfriend and he was really drunk. We were talking about potentially going on a trip to Amsterdam in the future and then he said ‚Äòyeah we could always go to a brothel there and pick out girls‚Äô which I was somewhat into initially, and then he said ‚Äòoh you know, if we find someone in general even outside of Amsterdam that we think is cute, we could ask each other if we can bring them to the bedroom‚Äô. \n\nI was like ‚Äòwhat, do you wanna be in an open relationship?‚Äô I was really confused and weirdly felt kinda hurt, like I wasn‚Äôt good enough. So then he said ‚Äònot an entirely open relationship, no. You brought up before, kind of in passing, that you‚Äôd be down to have a threesome, so I‚Äôm just putting that out there.‚Äô I was like ‚Äòoh, well my most recent previous experience with a threesome was really bad‚Äô (My ex accused me of cheating during a consensual threesome, and used this as leverage to actually go cheat.) \n\nI recapped the above for him, then said ‚ÄòFor me, this is fine with just the two of us. I didn‚Äôt know that you wanted this‚Äô and he was like ‚ÄòI just brought it up in case it would be a possibility, because I thought you had said you‚Äôd be down for a threesome before, but just say the word and I‚Äôll never mention it again.‚Äô I said ‚Äòyeah, I think my wild days are behind me. Don‚Äôt mention it again‚Äô and he said ‚Äòokay‚Äô and the rest of our night was lovely.\n\nI feel really frustrated and distant from him now. I‚Äôm not sure why.

I was supposed to pick her up at 10, but she messaged me earlier and wanted me to come sooner to join the party. I loved that. This was a new situation for us, and it meant the world to me that she thought of me and wanted me there. \n\nI showed up, and we had an absolutely wonderful time. We danced, mingled, I got to meet her co-workers, and it was honestly a blast. My girlfriend was drunk to a point that I'd never seen her and she was being incredibly \"friendly\"/\"touchy-feely\" with everyone at the party. This was very odd for me because even though she is a friendly person, her and I are both quite introverted people and mostly keep to ourselves. I know there was no sexual intent behind her friendliness or touches, but it genuinely bothered me because of how often it was happening. Chest touches, running hand down chest, hands on shoulders/biceps, etc. I'm not worried that she would ever escalate those touches, but I see it as a matter of respect for your partner. I would not do this with or without her around and would not think it's okay, regardless of my state.\n\nI genuinely want to know if I am wrong for feeling this way or if this is a normal emotion to have in a monogamous relationship.

We are perfect in every aspect except one thing, he has a habit of going online on dating apps. \n\nIn the beginning of the relationship, my friends caught him on bumble a couple times and I confronted him. He said it was for his ego boost and won‚Äôt do it again if it hurts me. I caught him flirting with girls on instagrams and he admitted he met them on tandem (language exchange app) and lure them into follow his instagram account. He explained that he gets flirty because it works the best to gain more followers on insta. \n\nI never believed this excuse and developed a bad habit of peaking into his phones to check if he is still doing it. This tandem thing is still ongoing after 2 years. Sometimes I catch him texting girls for a long period of time, calling them sweet names and sending half naked selfies.\n\nI was deeply hurt and became insecure. We had many fights and long talks where I confront him about these and he calls me crazy and toxic for looking into his phone. We came to a conclusion that we both stop doing this. I still believe that he won‚Äôt actually cheat on me as we are together almost 24/7 and he only uses fake name and age online. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs some sort of a habit he does when he is bored.\n\nEver since, I haven‚Äôt looked into his phone for a while until a random girl on instagram warned me that she talked to my bf on tinder. (He gave her his insta and she saw that he has photos of me there) I confronted and he denied it was him and that someone hacked his account. \n\nAnd now I was away for a trip for a week and it was as our first time apart. I came back to find he was on bumble, tinder, hinge and some random chat apps. (Yes, I went through his phone again and I saw deleted email confirmations for the app‚Äôs account register)\n\nI know people usually advice to break up if the partner is constantly on dating apps. But I believe my bf isn‚Äôt actually looking for a new girl. He is genuinely happy with me and we have many upcoming plans together. \n\nWe are great in all the other aspects and I don‚Äôt want to break up because of his bad online flirting habits. Maybe the way I communicate has been wrong or ineffective. I want to have a talk with him about downloading all these apps while I was away. I want him to really underatand that this is the very last warning. If he really doesn‚Äôt improve, I cannot continue this relationship where I am not heard.\n\nI need advice on :\n1. How do I make him understand that I consider online flirting as cheating too? Ofc I told him all about it and my feelings but I feel like he doesn‚Äôt take any of my confrontations seriously.  I cried, i tried to  take a break but we are still here. \n2. How do I stop going through his phone? How do I regain my trust for him? But at the same time, how would I know he is not doing it again? \n\nTLDR: I have a bad habit of going through my bf‚Äôs phone and always catch my bf on online dating apps or flirting with girls on insta. All fights and confrontation is not stopping him. How do we both stop this vicious cycle?"

I burried his head on my chest and told him to cry all he needed because i was there for him.\n\nAfter a while he was calmer, i asked him why he fought whit his dad. He said his father manipulated him, his father made him believe i was awfull and that i hated him. He and his dad fought because because my to wanted met me and his dad got mad.\n\nThey fought about it and my son is now living with his Grandparents because of it.\n\nMy son asked me about my life. I told him i had gotten remarried to a good man and had two twin daughters.\n\nMy son asked if he could see some pictures of them, i showed him some pictures and started crying again and said he was sorry again.\n\nWe spent the rest of the evening catching up and my son asked me if i could sleep with him, i told him i would have to talk to my husband. I called my husband he said it was ok if i slept with my son and that he was so happy for me.\n\nMe and my son slept in his room, it reminded me when we slept together when he was a baby.\n\nAftee my son was already asleep i started crying out of happiness.\n\nTLDR: I FINALLY HAVE MY BOY BACK."

                "body": "My ex (22F) broke up with me (24M) after ten months of amazing relationship.\n\nWe did amazing stuff, we both cried of emotion having sex, talked about a future together, shared how we felt \"fulfilled\" or \"plenitude\" with the other person. Our life goals were aligned, we were very attracted to each other (although she sometimes seemed less interested in sex than I was), our families loved the relationship, we share our main interests in life, felt very safe and connected... It overall seemed like a very fulfilling relationship. Specially for her, I was the first true boyfriend she had and the only guy to meet her parents till now, the only one who has treated her right. She was the pursuer for the first 3 months or so. On the ninth month I could feel that the limerence was fading and the relationship was becoming a different thing from the volcano of emotion and desire that it was in the beggining; I had doubts myself about this person being the right one for me but could manage them well.\n\nThree weeks before the breakup or so my gf started to get cold out of the blue in very subtle ways (less interest in sex, not so proactive to meet up, caused a couple calm arguments). After two more weeks of an increasing confusion in her mind, she was still having a lot of doubts and had developed a platonic emotional affair with a teacher of hers (despicable 40-something bald guy who pursues innocent students). This made things even more messy. I couldn't take it anymore, she wouldn't make a decision and the whole situation was slowly destroying my mental health. I really tried, but at some point we both saw that it was impossible, she couldn't make up her mind, clearly she couldn't be in a relationship with me having all these doubts and confusion about her emotions, although she said she loved me, she didn't want to lose me, she felt crazy and like this was a mistake, and she had been really depressed for two weeks. So we broke up.\n\nWe came across each other some days after that (we go to the same college) and she seemed very sad, and so did I. We saw each other again to return the stuff we still had at each other's house. She still seemed very emotional two weeks into the breakup, and from the conversation we had I could tell that she missed me like crazy, she was still attracted to me and there was some romantic thing still alive within us. But she was confused still and we just kissed and hugged and said goodbye. One week later we came across each other again, and so I offered to go for some drinks in the evening. She accepted, and it was wonderful: we were lovebirds again, we could stop talking about the breakup and emotions and just be together again having a good time. Then she said that she wanted to go back to no contact for some days and I accepted, I could see things steering in the right direction. One week later we came across each other in the train and she said she wanted me back. I said \"ok, I'm open to that\" and we agreed to meet up at mi place in the evening. She brought some biscuits as a make up gesture and seemed very insecure and anxious, really wanting me to take her back. So I profited on my just recovered power to talk about the relationship straight away (big mistake): I talked about the things I thought she had done wrong (initiating an emotional affair mainly, and not being clear at all about her emotions dragging me with her chaos). She seemed to understand, and said that the relationship with the teacher was over (it never was more than texting and having some talks at college. I know nothing happened between them, it was platonic all the way) and that she loved me and couldn't lose me. The rest of the conversation was wholesome about mending the relationship and about the things we liked and disliked in each other behaviour. We slept together and she asked me to be together again, and I agreed (big mistake, should have been more cautious and patient).\n\nDuring the next days, she slowly started getting more and more confused again. I acted somewhat needy, asking at some points how she was feeling. But then she told me that she was going to attend to a seminar where this teacher I mentioned is the moderator of student's presentations. I said that I didn't feel confortable with this, that I thought it was a mistake and she shouldn't do it (big mistake on my side: putting more pressure on an already under pressure relationship, acting insecure). Then it was her birthday and I did a grand gesture kind of thing, renting an hotel room and filling it with candles, chocolates and a couple gifts. Her words: \"I do not deserve to be treated this nicely by you (in tears)\". I said that it was just normal, it was her birthday and I wanted her to know how special she was. We had kind of a nice evening, slept together in the hotel room. She kept on getting colder and I could tell she was faking affection at some points. So, just a week after getting back together, I slept over at her place and she decided to break up again after a very sad night with lots of crying on both ends (specially on mine). She said \"she had to do this\", but she didn't seem confident at all in her decision. She said she had \"lost the spark\", she didn't feel \"passion\" and she couldn't \"give me what I deserve from a relationship right now\". She even said she wanted to have a chance together in the future when all this mess was behind us, and she got jealous about a girl from my class that was making moves on me lately. But she broke up. The next two days I initiated contact, one day for closure (I wanted to part in a more mature, less dramatic way) and next day to discuss some logistics and to apologize for being controlling on the seminar thing. We broke up amicably, with much love still between us, kissing till the last moment, and in a very respectful way, having decided to build ourselves separately so hopefully one day we can be together again (of course I didn't say that I would wait for her, or that I would always love her, or any of that bs).\n\nI had to text her for some unavoidable logistical reasons a week ago and she said she missed me a lot, she was struggling not to contact me and she loved me but had to force herself to wait \"enough time\" because it's \"too soon\". (I know she loves me and doesn't want to hurt me, and everytime we have seen each other it's like magnets, we are very attracted to each other). Anyhow, the whatsapp conversation was quick,  I said \"talk soon (kiss emoji)\" she said she wished to see me soon and \"talk soon (kiss emoji\" (but offered no concrete plans and I didn't want to be pushy or excited so I considered this breadcrumbs and the conversation was over).\n\nAnd that's it. Up to now still in no contact (3rd week). I am hopeful that she will reach out and I will have a second shot at this to manage things in a more confident way, taking it slow and being in control. But everyday that passes by I feel more hopeless, and the grief starts to settle in. I just want to know, am I being tricked and manipulated? Why is she doing this? What's wrong with her, what does she want? I want to be with her, reach out to her, but I'm hurt, and I cannot be the one to reach out. She did the dumping and she knows where to find me. Should I text her to help her in case she is afraid to reach out? How long shall I wait? Is there really hope, or is she already over me? Maybe many of these questions can't be answered, but it already feels good to put them out there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My 22F girlfriend broke up with me (24M) after 9 beautiful months. She had doubts. Then got back together three weeks later, and she broke up again after a week because after the two initial days she was confused again. She didn't feel the \"spark\", the \"passion\". It's been three weeks of (almost) strict no contact and I want to be hopeful: we have a very strong connection, we are attracted to each other and she misses me a lot. What can I expect? Has anyone been through anything similar?"

The previous 2 we have been trying for a baby and been unsuccessful. As a result it has put a big strain on our marriage and there has definitely been some disconnect between us.\n\nWe have acknowledged this and decided to work on things‚Ä¶ however‚Ä¶ wife has an online connection with someone she met on social media. She told me they‚Äôre friends, chatting about shared interests etc. but after seeing messages coming through on her unattended iPad, it appears there is a romantic element to their chats. My wife has lied about her name to this person and her marital status.\n\nI have called her out on this, especially after noticing how this same person was blocked on my social media. I hadn‚Äôt blocked them, why would I? I don‚Äôt know them. My wife admitted to going on my phone and blocking them which only made me more suspicious about the true nature of their relationship.\n\nHere‚Äôs the conflicting thing. We are in the UK. This other person is not. Wife spends all day messaging this person, and when confronted refuses to stop texting them. Claims she is having a fake online relationship with this person for ~their benefit as this person is lonely. Most of their conversations are apparently day to day chatting etc and wife assures me the romantic side isn‚Äôt overtly there. It‚Äôs almost this unspoken comfort thing between them.\n\nHere‚Äôs my issue. I don‚Äôt 100% believe wife. I feel like I‚Äôve been gaslighted about the whole thing. Made to feel crazy for asking and aggressive when I push for the messaging to be toned down when all I‚Äôm trying to do is find a compromise. I have no issue with online friendships if that‚Äôs what they really are.\n\nAs we agreed to work on our marriage I find it hard and disrespectful that wife continues to message this person. We agreed to spend a quiet Christmas together this year and when I asked for the texting to not happen on this day I was essentially told no and made to feel that our quiet, relaxing Christmas should be treated as any other day. That‚Äôs not what I thought we had agreed or what I wanted.\n\nI feel like wife has her priorities as this person >>>> me, and it‚Äôs beyond hurtful.\n\nBut I love my wife and want to try and repair our marriage. I feel conflicted. Do I let this messaging play out (the chance of them meeting IRL is slim to none) or do I draw the line and end things now over this ridiculous fake online relationship?"

He treats me so well, he takes care of me, and we have fun together. But I‚Äôve always had this haunting thought that I might be gay. (I had dated women before him and he knew me to be pansexual). We talked about it multiple times throughout the years but never really addressed it beyond that.\n\nIn year 7, I got a job as a flight attendant and used it as an out. We broke up and I moved across the country and came out as a lesbian to all my new friends. I met a girl (27/f) in FA training and we‚Äôve been dating for the past year.

I love her more then anything, and anyone. She loves me too. She says she loves me, she talks to me like she would only talk to her love. I KNOW she loves me. She tells me every day.\n\nBut the problem is, She has a boyfriend. Let me explain this whole thing.\n\nSo we met through a friend. My friend shouted me out on his profile, and she added me through it. We started talking, and she told me directly that she had a boyfriend as soon as I started some VERY low amounts of flirting.\n\nI was like ‚Äúthats ok, sorry.‚Äù And she said it was fine.\n\nNow, the thing is, she kept talking to me. At first it was just talking, but then she started getting clingy. And was talking to me all the time. I was a little creeped out to be honest, and I tried to let her down easy, but I just didn‚Äôt have the heart to say ‚ÄúHey, you have a boyfriend.‚Äù\n\nThe thing about me is, I‚Äôm a very loving, caring guy. I‚Äôm pretty good looking, and I‚Äôm just a perfect guy for some women. I treated her with respect, and didn‚Äôt try to do anything to her, and I was just really kind. Apparently, that made her really like me and want to continue talking to me.\n\nShe wanted to talk more and more. Soon, she started asking me to hug her. She asked if she could call me by a nickname. (A very very cute nickname it is). I said no to the hugs at first, but said yes to the nickname.\n\nThen, she started showing more and more interest. She told me that she loves me, and made it very obvious that she wanted me.\n\nI kept denying and denying, but I started giving in slowly and slowly. Because I started to really click with her. More then I‚Äôve ever done with anyone else.\n\nSoon, I started to fall in love with her.\n\nNow the thing about this is, this girl is a senior in highschool, while I‚Äôm a junior. (I‚Äôm a few months older then her however)\n\nShe has a boyfriend, who is 20 years old. This boyfriend, has done things. He‚Äôs cheated on her, several times. He‚Äôs threatened her, and he uses her for her body and it‚Äôs so obvious. He lives almost next door from her. She‚Äôs known him most of her life. This guy also has pets. Pets that she has known for a long time and has grown very attatched to them. This guy, he asks her for intercourse all the time. He even asked her to start working out. He flirted with her close friend, WHO IS 12 YEARS OLD. He held hands with her while in the car, and told her friend that he liked her. She has the text messages. He does a lot of things to her, that she doesn‚Äôt tell people. She doesn‚Äôt tell me everything.\n\nI treat her so well, she is so amazing in every way. She deserves so much better. I love her, I‚Äôve been there for her through it all. I don‚Äôt use her for her body, because I love her for who she is. She tells me she wants me. She tells me I‚Äôm the guy she wants to be with. The guy she wants to have children with, and grow old with. And I know that that‚Äôs what she wants.\n\nBut she won‚Äôt leave this guy. She refuses. No matter what he does to her, no matter how much he hurts her, she goes back to him. I‚Äôve known her for 4 months. She has told me so many times ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna break up with him.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait until next month.‚Äù Next month comes, and she tells me that she wants to wait another. Then he hurts her again, and it‚Äôs the same thing. She comes to me to get loved like she wants, but she goes back to him. She tells me that ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not in a state to leave him rn‚Äù And tells me that she‚Äôll do it on her own.\n\nAnd I push for her to break up with him. not for myself, but for her. All I want is for her to be happy, and she knows thats all I care about. She doesn‚Äôt have to be with me, but the guy she‚Äôs with, won‚Äôt stop hurting her. She knows that that‚Äôs the truth, but she won‚Äôt leave him.\n\nIt is tearing me apart. Not only that she‚Äôd rather stay with this guy that doesn‚Äôt care about her, but that she won‚Äôt even try to put a stop to her getting hurt.\n\nI know there are some factors at play here that I‚Äôm not aware of, but I swear to you that she isn‚Äôt happy with this guy. I see it in her eyes. He doesn‚Äôt treat her right. She knows he doesn‚Äôt. SHE KNOWS. She cries to me and wants me to comfort her and I do, But she just won‚Äôt leave him.\n\nWhat do I do.. I love her so much, and I‚Äôm the one she wants to be with, but she just won‚Äôt leave him.\n\nPlease help‚Ä¶"

                "body": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for two and a half years and living together for almost 2 of those years now. \n\nWhen I first start coming to hang out at his house it was stereotypical bachelor for the most part (minus the nice bed+headboard and there were actually hand towels out and in use). Still had most of his second hand Wal-Mart furniture from college, sink full of dishes, hairs from shaving all over the bathroom, laundry piled halfway up to the ceiling. \nWe met during the pandemic and were both essential workers in different fields getting called in for additional shifts when co-workers got sick. Working 60+ hours a week my place wasn‚Äôt completely spotless either so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. \n\nNow that we have lived together for a while and gotten to know each other more (and have gotten some nicer furniture) I‚Äôve found that his desire to have a clean house is non-existent. He has always had his mom come visit from out of state a couple times a year and she‚Äôll end up in a cleaning frenzy and get him caught up with his laundry. He even went to college in his hometown so his mother would come frequently to do his laundry and tidy his and his roommates place. And it wasn‚Äôt a situation where he refused to clean, he was never told or shown how. \n\nWe are both in therapy (separately for different things) and he was diagnosed recently with being on the autism spectrum. He has a really hard time with starting and completely tasks but if I cue him to do something he does it without complaining. (Sometimes the occasional groan if he was about to sit down to play video games)\n\nWe both have well paying jobs, he makes more money than I do. When I expressed I wanted to cut down in hours at work to work on some house projects we‚Äôve neglected during the pandemic and prepare to continue my education he was 1000% supportive. He truly wants and supports anything that makes me happy. \nSince the dynamic was shifting I said I would be fine if we had a 70/30 split with housework but I even prefaced- he will probably feel like he is doing more housework since on a good week he maybe does 5%. Washing his own work clothes, taking the trash can to the curb, and taking the trash out when I prompt him. He needs direct instruction when it comes to household tasks. If I give him a list of tasks to do I have to write ‚Äúget the kitchen cleaner from under the sink and spray and wipe off the counters‚Äù if I say ‚Äúwhen you get a chance walk around the house and pick up trash‚Äù or ‚Äútidy around your desk‚Äù that is too broad of a task. And he won‚Äôt do it because he doesn‚Äôt know where to start. \nAlso if I say ‚Äútake half an hour to fold and put away your laundry‚Äù, when the half hour is up he drops everything he is doing and walks away even if there‚Äôs only a couple pieces of laundry left to put away. \n\nI have my own relational trauma related to a past abusive relationship and having abusive parents. Having to tell him what to do since he has no sense of anticipating needs causes me a lot of stress. I used to not ask and just try and do it all to avoid the panic the possibility of confrontation brings. I‚Äôve really worked in therapy on asking for help and to make things fair. He is always open to when I express I need more help with the housework and will say he wants to help me out however he can but he wants me to be firm with him and tell him what to do. \n\nI have said how uncomfortable it makes me. Like having to be so direct has even brought me to tears because it is so uncomfortable for me. But he has zero sense to anticipate needs, it may be a neurodivergent thing and also that he has never been shown - if you finish eating put your plate in the dishwasher or if you open an amazon box throw it away, don‚Äôt just leave it in the middle of the floor. He has said when I ask that he wants me to boss him around and tell him what to do because it helps him. But I get frustrated because I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have to tell him to throw away a soda can when it is empty or put brushing his teeth on his chore list because it makes me feel more like a mom than a partner. \n\nWe are planning to do some therapy together and I have also tried chore charts, asking him to set reminders on his phone, his therapist has even given him daily house hold tasks on certain days of the week but that only lasted a single week even with my encouragement and prompting. I have read the fair play method and would like him to get the audiobook or watch the documentary with me. But outside of that I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm not wanting our home to be perfect or spotless by any means. Just don‚Äôt want dishes to sit in the sink for the whole week if he says he will do them or the carpet to have a visible layer of dirt and crumbs for weeks when he says he will vacuum. I also don‚Äôt want to enable the behaviors by coming behind and end up doing all his tasks for him. \nHas anyone had success in a similar situation? What are some things that worked for you?"

Me and my boyfriend never met in person and we‚Äôve had issues in our relationship for a long time, we were on and off but never stopped talking for a day and we still don‚Äôt wanna let each other go but I think he‚Äôs not right for hanging out with her. One of our issues was that he used to say that she‚Äôs weird and cute. But now he saw that her intentions were good and she‚Äôs kind, good and always notices him. That he usually felt alone. And he ‚Äúdeveloped feelings for this cuteness‚Äù. And that he loves me in a different way.. After a while he said he was confused and he loves me and never stopped. Our relationship is actually very fucked up.\n\nSo they watch movies, play games and eat and stuff together. I told him it‚Äôs not okay for me and stuff, so he knows how I feel about it but he said he doesn‚Äôt want to end her friendship because she‚Äôs been very good and such. And then I said that I can let him go if he wants to but he also said he wouldn‚Äôt want it ever. So I am confused. \nHe went to sleep after and I started ignoring because I have no energy to talk to him anymore. He will wake up soon and see that I didn‚Äôt respond. He‚Äôs probably going to keep hanging out with her, so.. idk. What do you think? I need your opinion on this situation. You can ask me for more details.\n\nBtw I didn‚Äôt tell him but I might go to his country this summer and wanted to meet him as surprise maybe.. but I‚Äôm not sure anymore.

No issues whatsoever, and even if we reached a point of contention it was resolved within minutes. Around two weeks ago, we had been seeing a lot of each-other and she slowly started to seem less and less interested and was laughing less with me and stuck to her phone a lot of the time, the s*x stopped and she offered very little in the way of conversation. This in itself isn‚Äôt the problem, as I know silence is a sign of comfort and trust etc.. The problem however is that she just seemed generally uninterested in me and the relationship as a whole. Concerned, I asked her what was up and she said our humours didn‚Äôt align and she wasn‚Äôt sure she could see this progressing. I was fairly p*ssed off with this response as only two weeks prior she was asking me to consider going to Australia with her and was telling me how much she liked me and it scared her. Anyway, we agreed to take a break and I texted her later asking her if she could drop all of my stuff off at a later date as I didn‚Äôt really have any intention of sticking around for a ‚Äòbreak‚Äô and she responded saying that she didn‚Äôt want a break and asked if we could just restart everything and rediscover excitement. Anyway, two days after we agreed to try it out again she asked if we were alright as we hadn‚Äôt been speaking (she had been at work both those days where you aren‚Äôt allowed to use your phone) or whether or not we should call it quits. I tried to call her but she ignored the call and we spoke over the phone the following evening and it came down to her misreading the situation. Now however, i‚Äôm not seeing her until next week and she‚Äôs always taking ages to reply to my texts and when she does just replied with no interest etc. Wondering what I should do here as I feel a bit of a mug tbh.

We were deep in the honeymoon phase, had lots of chemistry.\n\nIt started getting ugly when he began talking to other girls, specifically his ex. To me, she was so perfect and beautiful, and I was immediately jealous. I began comparing myself to her and it got really ugly. I still sometimes compare myself to her after all this time. It‚Äôs sad.\n\nAt that point I should have left him. I did, for about a week, then we got back together again. We spent the next few years fighting off and on, then having wonderful makeup sex without actually solving our problems. This became a cycle. Hitting began, so did name-calling. His family started to hate me, and mine hated him too. Yet we stayed together because we ‚Äúloved‚Äù each other.\n\nLate last year, I met another man. I broke up with my boyfriend to date him instead. Then, my biggest regret happened, something I‚Äôll always hate myself for and never be able to take back. I began cheating on my new boyfriend by seeing my abusive ex and having sex with him. It was my first time doing something like this to anyone. I‚Äôm so ashamed to even admit this.

I wasn‚Äôt really annoyed, we‚Äôre both college students and I know money is tight.

I called my sister and she gave me enough money for an Uber to get home.\n\nThat was it for me. I‚Äôm done. Completely. He tried texting me after and I saw the cycle beginning to repeat itself again.

Before he bought it he mentioned I would look beautiful in the red dress, but I just know I won't feel confident or comfortable in it. I usual wear loose or baggy clothing (this is due mostly because of my adhd and I only like certain textures). I feel his is more a gift  to him  than for me.

I've been together with my current girlfriend for 5 years now shes 2 years younger than me at 24. We met in 2018 through mutual friends and became extremely close extremely fast . She started living in my house, and by my house, I mean the bedroom in my parents' house; shortly under a year of dating. Everything seemed so perfect , she was studying and I was working and we spent massive amounts of time together. We never fought or had any serious problems. It felt like a fairytale. Fast forward 3 years to 2021, and she's ready to start her second degree . I've been head over heels for 3 years. There's no way I'm letting her go . So I followed her to another city 3 hours away from our hometown where she could finish school . This was awesome because we could finally have our own space , and our relationship could grow . \n\nThis is where things take a twist. So, while attending university, she meets a new guy friend (of course), let's say his name is Moose . At first, Moose seems like no trouble at all , he's friendly , nice guy , doesn't seem like the type to do anything . But we all know a man's intentions & I jokingly told her that from the beginning, \nbut never had any real thought that she would do something like that to me . She's always been heavily against cheating and anything to do with it.  Weeks turned to months , and I started noticing small things, I work till 7pm most nights, so she gets home before me 90% of the time . But the odd occasion I'd beat her home I'd notice she was getting a ride home from Moose & they would talk in the vehicle for what seemed like hours (probably 20-30min in reality) . Nothing too suspicious, I thought, I brought it up to her, and she told me he drives her home from time to time , fair enough (Let it be known we live 5 minutes from her school) . A few more weeks go by, and suddenly, she's asking me to hang out with him frequently, i.e... go over to his house , ride his motorcycle, go for a walk,  blah blah blah . This is eventually what kinda fires up the pilot light of my jealousy . \n\n\nI start to think maybe there's something more here , or at least he's trying to make it more . I start to voice my concerns , I'm not the best. I get very quiet and resentful when I'm upset, but I eventually let her know I'm feeling some type of way about her new friendship with Moose . She assures me he's just a friend , he's a nice Muslim guy who wouldn't do anything like that , and that I need to trust her. I thought she was right, and I was being crazy. She's never shown any sign or red flag about being disloyal before, so I tried to move on . I don't wanna be the possesive boyfriend and stop her from having friends . So once again, I ate my emotions and tried to move forward . \n\n\nHere we are a year and a half now with things only getting worse. She started to hide the fact that she was talking/hanging out/getting rides because I would always initiate an argument about it . I started to get extremely paranoid about what they were doing while hanging out, and frankly , why she wanted to see him so often. So, one night, we got into an argument, and she told me that over the past year of living here, she's felt like I've been emotionally unavailable and can't talk to me . She's been struggling with body dismorphia and extreme anxiety, so Moose has been her vent . He has been her shoulder to cry on for almost a year . I'm lost at this moment , I've been so focused on what she's doing with Moose. I completely looked over the fact that I could be the reason she wants to see him .. This hit me hard, and we had a huge discussion and aired everything out . She once again assured me she has never done anything with him and \"he's not like that.\" I asked her to let me know everytime their hanging out or that he would drive her home . So, for the past 2-3 weeks, things have been smooth. I was trying to be better and supportive , putting her first . I made sure I attended to her needs and knew that I'm here for her for anything . \n\n\nOnce again, the paranoia sets in, and I have all kinds of thoughts running through my head while I'm at work . I decided to text her but get no reply for a few hours, which isn't unusual as she's normally studying. Then, a short burt of messages . I reply immediately and then again a few hours go by no reply ? I start to really get into my own head here . I text her and ask if she's sleeping , and she finally replies and \"Yes, she fell asleep.\"\nAt this point I'm not buying it so I decide to call her , she answered and spoke fine nothing out of the ordinary so it seemed , but I couldn't get through the day wondering what she was doing here . So I made an excuse to leave work early & sure enough, I get home and see his car parked in our apartment lot . Im furious, I walk in to find him standing in our foyer and my girlfriend crying in the bathroom . I spoke with him briefly outside, and he told me it's nothing and that this situation isn't what it seems.  I believed his dumbass. I went back inside to speak with her and get to the bottom of what was really happening. She's crying and can barely get the words out but tells me that he made a move on her . He put his hands down her pants and fingered here for what she said was mere seconds before she pushed him off . Which I don't really buy considering the guy was here for hours . She starts acting apologetic. She really seems remorseful and feels terrible. Saying she's deleting him of everything, blocking him, and cutting off all communication. At the end of the day, she still sees him at school every day and will continue to for the next 2 years . So, who's to say this will never happen again ? \n\n\nNow, here we are , 5 years into a relationship, and I'm not sure I wanna continue . I feel so betrayed and heartbroken . Now I know she didn't have sex with him or go any further than what happened , but what she did was cheating and unacceptable.  Especially after months of telling how I feel & how I don't like the situation going on with her and Moose . I poured my heart out, and she told me I was being crazy and that she's allowed to have friends . She made me feel like I was a bad boyfriend for being so nosy and jealous .. I just don't know what to say or do. I'm at such a loss . She's begging me to forgive her and fix things. She's been crying all day and night now . I started writing this last night and have slept on the couch ever since I don't know what to do. Move back to my hometown ? Pack all my things and leave her? Why is it so hard to do . I love her with everything I am , I gave her everything, and she let me down in the worst way . It's so hard to let her get away with this .. I want her to hurt like I do . I want her to know she's ruined and stepped on something that meant so much to me , that was our love .. \n\nI appreciate anyone who reads this. I know it's a long story that means nothing to anyone but me . But i really needed to voice myself somewhere. \n\n\nLong story short: I moved cities for my 5 year GF , she made a new guy friend and I kept warning her about getting to close with him . After a year and a half, he finally pulled a move and got his hands down my girls pants. I'm furious but love her so much and at such a cross between leaving and staying."

And when that didnt work out he came back saying he missed me. I was very very cautious about taking him back (almost didnt as I have never taken anyone back before out of self-respect) and tried talking about why things ended, how to fix things and move forward, etc. For about a month things were almost normal, but I was still taking it one day at a time, and not going all in. I had a feeling he still had 'feelings' for the girl he had been seeing after the breakup. 2 weeks ago I get the 'idk what I want...' and we had a long talk that I consider as a second breakup. I basically told him to figure out what he wants and that I'm not going to do this alone, and I deserve someone who wants me. And walked away.\n\nAfter a week of no contact (I considered us done-done), he reached out and I was friendly. Since then he's been blowing up my phone, messaging me, sending me videos/memes, and joking with me, etc. more than he ever did at the end of our relationship. And it feels like how we were when we first started dating. \n\nThe confusing part is that he keeps offering to help me with little things that I mention. And its been like 3 or 4 things in the last week that he's offered to help with, without me asking for help. There's even been a few things he or I have mentioned doing together. But I dont know if he's being friendly as just a friend or if he's interested in me as a partner. We haven't made any concrete plans to meet. There hasnt been any 'i miss you' or 'i want to see you' or major flirting (only a little). And I honestly dont know how to respond. Im actually back on dating apps and already had a date and have another lined up. And I've been treating my ex as just a friend and not getting my hopes up again. But based on how he's acting, I cant tell if he's acting out of guilt and trying to be friendly or if he's trying to show he's ready to be a partner. To me, guys only invest time and energy into people they are truly interested in. Any advice? Do I just ask him or keep doing what Im doing and wait for him to clarify his intentions?"

While I knew I loved her, I wasn't ready at that time to say it. I said it regardless, and it's sat a little oddly with me since but it's nothing too serious.\n\nThe main issue is that we broke about two weeks ago. She's had issues with weed, was majorly depressed, and hated her job. I've taken care of a lot of my previous partners to my own detriment. For a while I supported her through this period, but it began to take a toll on me and she ultimately said she wanted to take a step back as she was feeling burnt out on life. I accepted the situation, and when we finally hung out about two weeks later, she was asleep. I wasn't upset by this, but it did solidify to me that she wasn't able to meet my needs.\n\nI asked her whether she thought she was in a good place for a relationship now, or whether this was proving to be more taxing on her when she should be focusing on herself. She admitted she wasn't in the right place for a relationship and so we broke up knowing we still cared for each other.\n\nHowever, she quickly realised she'd made a mistake and that she didn't want to lose the relationship. This sent alarm bells for me, as my last serious partner broke up with me saying she thought she was asexual, but then came back to tell me she lied because she was scared. Unsure of how even I felt about the situation, I said we should not talk for a month and come back to see where we were at.\n\nI was fairly convinced I wouldn't want to get back together by months end, but the last day before I left we went out for a mutual friend's graduation party and it was great! We had fun, we laughed, we danced, we drank, it was everything we'd been missing. In the two weeks when we'd broken up, she'd thrown away all her weed, started exercising, gone back to regular therapy, and quit her job. She's been sober for three weeks now and I'm really happy for her.\n\nBut now I'm unsure what to do when that month comes around. I've spent a long time in an unhealthy fixation on the perfect relationship and person. I know she's not perfect but she's putting the work right now, and that seems like a very important thing. I don't want to always be looking for 'better' as much as I want to be with someone who will genuinely cherish me. \n\nThoughts?"

Any help is appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2021 I had just gone through a bad breakup and was living my best life dating many fun people. The relationship I'd had was quite horrible for me, and almost as soon as it ended I quickly started enjoying meeting new people. One day I matched with someone on Tinder, let's call him Rob. We had the most amazing conversations and started talking daily. I felt a profound connection to him for some reason - I couldn't explain what it was or why I felt that. I thought we had so much in common and that for the first time I'd met someone who understood me and saw me for who I was. We weren't even dating at first, because he got back together with his ex, and I was happily seeing another guy at the time anyway. We kept talking regardless because we found each other so relatable and the conversations were valuable to us.\n\nOur story in a nutshell: One day Rob texted me saying that he and his ex broke up for good, and asked me on a date. I was more excited than I'd ever been about meeting someone, and after the first date, I felt like he was \"the one\" for me. I know it sounds silly but I guess everyone here knows that feeling when something feels so right. I felt like I'd known him my whole life and that feeling seemed mutual. We went on multiple dates but I felt like he wasn't as excited about me as I was about him, so I ended things. Soon after things ended, I told him I missed him and he said he felt the same way. We'd gotten very close this time around, spending a lot more time together and talking about everything, but something felt off the whole time. I was very worried about everything between us and in his personal life and he knew it. He was worried about my well-being due to his influence. Things got a bit weird again and he eventually broke things off with me. All of this lasted for about three or four months. We tried to stay friends afterward. It was my initiative but eventually failed.\n\nNow I keep going over that relationship in my head. I feel like a clown who was so attached to someone who possibly didn't ever love me back. I keep thinking (wishing) that maybe he misses me the same way but now it's too late to talk to me again. And then I think that he probably doesn't even remember my name. It's really painful. I've tried everything to move on, from being friends with him to dating literally everyone around me. Now I've come to a standstill where I can't form feelings for people, I compare everyone to him, and I hurt myself regularly by reminiscing over our times together and realizing that maybe I'll just never find that kind of a connection again. I have to move on and I thought it would happen with time, but nothing seems to have changed. I don't know what to do. Any tips would be greatly appreciated."

I (34F) will be celebrating the holidays with my extended family for the first time in many years. I have a cousin (20M) who has now fully transitioned to his truest self. My family and I have been very supportive and accepting of him and his identity, from initial discovery, through transition, and into now. \n\nMy dad (64M) is unfortunately terminal. Because of this, I‚Äôve recently digitized all of our old family VHS home movies. It‚Äôs been emotional and enjoyable to experience watching our lives when we were younger with with my immediate family and my dad, especially with him being healthy and happy in the videos, which has been a long time since I‚Äôve seen him as such. \n\nMy mom (63F) has told my extended family about the videos. We all were extremely close when I was younger, and so naturally, everyone has been texting me asking me to bring them to our holiday party so we can watch them together and reminisce. The trouble is, there is no way to avoid seeing my cousin pre-transition in these videos. I‚Äôm not sure what the visual version of deadnaming is, but I feel like this may make my cousin feel uncomfortable, which I obviously do not want to do. \n\nI don‚Äôt want to disappoint my entire family by not bringing the videos, and part of me also feels like I do not want to miss out on the cathartic experience of rewatching the videos together with my entire family there as part of my grieving process. But I also obviously do not want to hurt my cousin, cause awkwardness for him, or make him feel uncomfortable. What would you recommend I do in this case?\n\nEDIT: I know some have already recommended I ask him how he feels. His mom specifically asked I not show any videos that feature him pre transition (he had asked her to take down family photos of them in their house and such). He confided in her that it would not be an enjoyable experience for him. So I know it would make him uncomfortable.\n\nI‚Äôm struggling with what to do because I don‚Äôt want to rob my dad (and the rest of the family) of this experience since it‚Äôs likely the last holiday he will be here for and our family is traveling in from out of state for it. He‚Äôs now been looking forward to it because he‚Äôs mentioned he wants to show everyone some of the funny memories, and he so rarely has anything to look forward to nowadays. But I obviously don‚Äôt want to hurt my cousin either. I feel like there is no good choice here."

                "body": "Me (22M) and my girlfriend (21F) have an amazing relationship that's been going on for 2 years. Prior to getting together for real, we fooled around for a while casually. For a long time, we were having sex a few times a week. It was pretty good, we got used to each other, figured out what we liked, experimented. I can't remember exactly how long ago this was, but I'm guessing around 6 months ago, the sex came to a screeching halt. Now, for me, having sex a few times a week is mildly excessive, I'm okay with once or maybe twice, whatever happens. But twice in the last few months we've had stretches of 3 or 4 weeks where we won't do it. And we've even talked about it, she just said she doesn't always feel like doing it sometimes. I just don't know how that's possible, especially with how much she tells me she wants to. The one time per month we do have sex though, it's mindblowing. Not just for me either, I make sure she gets everything she needs and has a great time. Here's how it goes down. We'd be watching TV and she'd say, let's do it after this episode. And then the episode would finish and she'd say, can we just watch one more first? And I'd say sure, and then by the end of the episode she wouldn't be in the mood anymore. This happened a frustratingly huge amount of times. We'd be talking on the phone or facetime and she'd say, wow, I really wanna f-ck you tomorrow. I'd see her, and it wouldn't happen because she wasn't in the mood. We'd be at a party and she would pull me aside, make out with me, grab my dingaling and tell me how badly she wanted to smash. An hour later when everyone goes home she'd tell me she didn't want to anymore. It just feels unfair to constantly be strung along, to continue to be given empty promises and false hope. It's gotten to the point where I'm afraid to initiate because I know I'll get turned down 9 outta 10 times. I just go with the flow and let her decide when we're gonna do it, even if it's once a month. I've tried explaining to her that I've got needs and wants too, and I'm not asking to bang every time I see her, I just think it's part of a healthy relationship. I feel unwanted and scared to initiate anything with her because I know it'll either end up in an empty promise or a flat out no. I understand that I can't force her to have sex with me, and that's not what I want to do. I just want to feel like my needs are important too. There's never any compromise, I just feel like I have to change my ways and ignore my desires completely in order to meet her needs. What do I do?"

We've been long distance for most of it because he was studying in my country and has since graduated, and we've got a year and a half of LD to go. We make it work well and find ways to feel close.\n\nI am currently studying abroad on a Spanish island (and loving it), and going to the beach is pretty big here. The other week I went camping on a remote nudist beach with two friends (one 22, they/he; 23, he/him). Both of these friends are gay and there is obviously nothing between us. My partner knows this.\n\nI had once previously gone topless on the beach, and when I told my partner he wasn't thrilled about it (I have boobs) but it seemed like he would just rather I didn't, rather than a firm boundary. I understand why it might be an uncomfortable thought but I also believe that it's my body and my choice to go topless at the end of the day, and I'm in a place where going topless is the norm. I enjoy the freedom of it and I like being able to try something new in a safe environment where it's not an issue.\n\nBack to the camping trip: I was topless because everyone else was and it felt natural. I didn't explicitly tell my partner because it really wasn't a big deal to me and there was so much else to tell him about our adventures, but I never hid it. \n\nToday I mentioned to him that my friends had been surprised I didn't have nipple piercings (I have other piercings and my friends have piercings too). I hadn't realised he assumed I wasn't topless, and he suddenly got pretty angry about it and said I'd violated his boundaries. This was never my intention and I didn't realise he was so against it; I thought ultimately he respected my decision even if it wasn't what he would prefer.\n\nI'm torn between feeling guilty for violating a boundary and feeling angry that he feels he can set a boundary that is contexually illogical where I'm living (EVERYONE else was topless), it feels like an infringement on my bodily autonomy. I don't want to make this a big argument between us and part of me wants to just suck it up, but I also want to enjoy the freedom that everyone else has here. It's not a sexual thing for me at all.\n\nI have apologised to him for violating his boundary and explained I didn't realise he was so against it, but I can't decide if it's genuinely a fair boundary for him to set or an unreasonable expectation. I've had unhealthy relationships before so I'm sensitive to feeling controlled. And if everyone else is topless and I have to say that my partner said I'm not allowed, I'm going to feel like I'm being controlled.\n\nThis relationship is a priority and we won't break up over this, but where do we go from here? How do we make everyone happy? \n\nTL;DR: my partner (22m) is uncomfortable with me (22nb) going topless on beaches in a place where it's the norm, but I want to embrace the culture and the freedom of it. How do we handle this?"

I make about $100 K and have been struggling with obesity and severe OCD since I was a kid. I am ~250 at age 24 (height = 5‚Äô 10‚Äù).\n\nStory:\n\nMy parents have always been very demanding. As an only child, they would spoil me at times but they also had high expectations. They wouldn‚Äôt accept grades that weren‚Äôt an A which transitioned into A+, they wanted me to win all the awards in my city, they wanted and still want a lot. Yet even after achieving awards, finishing my undergrad and masters at an Ivy League, and getting a decent paying job in my eyes, our relationship is strained due to my weight. I have constantly been degraded about my appearance and have my weight mentioned to me daily. Their main concern is my health (which I understand fully). They don‚Äôt understand, or maybe they do, that I can‚Äôt control my weight all of a sudden. It‚Äôs a mindset and lifestyle change which I haven‚Äôt been able to make yet. We‚Äôve gotten to a point where my dad sends my long messages on how my weight is impacting them and how they don‚Äôt want to go through the pain of seeing me hospitalized. My mom screams at me and starts comparing me to other kids that I graduated with. She even says wishes something happens to her so she doesn‚Äôt have to witness the health conditions that will affect me. She even said this at a temple we were visiting (which triggered my OCD quite a bit, as I‚Äôm always worried for my parent‚Äôs wellbeing.) They‚Äôre now saying I need rehab and to quit my job. They always make comparisons when it comes to my job and my weight and how I didn‚Äôt achieve anything by going to an Ivy League school. All I did was gain weight, didn‚Äôt become a doctor, and got a mediocre job, which i don‚Äôt think it is.. it‚Äôs at a reputed consulting firm ):   \n\nAnyway this is really just me rambling at this point.. I feel worthless as I always have. Food is the only thing that gives me pleasure these days and that‚Äôs also leading to more problems. My parents have always been the only thing I cared about. If you asked me to truly reflect, yes I enjoyed achieving what I did but it was for them not me. I have a few close friends but I don‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing this with them. I dated my ex from 2018-2020. She made me feel valued. We broke up due to long distance due to covid. She was the only person I ever truly opened up to and I miss her everyday. I feel worthless and have a strained relationship with my parents and I don‚Äôt feel like I have anything left that‚Äôs of value.. I just feel empty and would like life advice on how I can get out of this feeling. I am going through therapy for my OCD right now but still feel so trapped by my mind and relationships, and I feel undervalued."

So he cuddles me on the couch and makes me watch some stupid tv show I don‚Äôt even want to watch.. I try touching his dick and after a little bit he tells me to  relax?? I‚Äôm like sooooooo irritated. I told him if he goes to sleep without fucking me I‚Äôll be pissed & he says ‚ÄúI know‚Äù then we both fell asleep so now I‚Äôm pissed and I do not want to talk to him. He always wants to be around me and all up on me but doesn‚Äôt want to give me any dick. That is annoying. Idk what his problem is and we talked about this before so idk what to do now. Also I‚Äôm very pretty and never had this problem with anyone else. Everyone else was the exact opposite couldn‚Äôt keep their hands off me. So idk what it is. Maybe he‚Äôs just lazy since the positions are simple too and he usually just wants head. But he‚Äôs pissing me off and now im sexually frustrated."

She lives in the UK I live in the US. After only a couple months it started going horribly and I realized I had to end it. Broke my heart. Fast forward to the beginning of November we begin talking again and quickly fall back into old routine and we‚Äôre treating our time together like we did when we were together. I made it clear I didn‚Äôt want another online relationship and that‚Äôd I want to seek something out in person how that would ever happen. However we exchanging i love you‚Äôs and overall it was about as close to a relationship you could get without the commitment. Anyways she deals with anger in her own type of way and tends to project it which upsets me. After awhile of that i was getting fed up and wanted to leave again. Instead I messaged this girl some sexual things in the moment of my emotions. It didn‚Äôt last long and I blocked this person before I could get a response but I felt the damage had been done. I felt horrible for days, and afterwards it felt like my whole view on her changed. She wasn‚Äôt an angry flawed character, she was a sweet soul who truly loves and cares about me. I couldn‚Äôt bear the guilt so I told her and she left. Her friends hate me, I think she hates me, and to be honest I‚Äôm kind of hating myself for this. I know we weren‚Äôt in a relationship but it felt like I had cheated. I know it wasn‚Äôt the right thing to do in my heart. She thinks that I‚Äôm a cheater and says I‚Äôm no better than the rest. Part of me wonders if that‚Äôs the truth. I want to be better but I‚Äôm not sure if I can. I‚Äôve never been in a real life relationship so this experience has been the majority of my experience with love. It just hurts, I feel like I threw something away that was special to me and could have been amazing if I worked hard enough. Not sure what to think, we never really discussed our situation or our boundaries. Just seeking some opinions."

                "body": "Hi there!\n\nI have some family drama and really need your advice!\n\nSooo... the backstory: \n\nWe are a family of 5: my Mum (53), my Dad (63), my Sister (24) my Brother (18) and myself (23). \n\nThis story also involves a family friend of ours, lets call her B (f, 51). B and her family have been friends with my family for about 20 years and she is one of my Mums best friends, a businesspartner/friend of my dads and my brothers godmother. \n\nAbout a month ago she was visiting my Mum, when I walked into our living room and it was... weird. At the time I thought they were hugging, but they instantly stopped and talked to me and it just felt like something was off. I instantly went upstairs again and told myself that I was reading to much into it. \n\nTwo weeks later I had just helped my Mum send something through Whats-App Web (old people and tech, you know how it is ;) ) when I used the computer and her phone and her messages opened and... I klicked on her messages to B (I know, a pretty shitty move, but she is normally really chill with her phone and doesn\\`t mind if we kids use it or read messages to other people soooo). \n\nWell, long story short: she is definitely having an affair with B, for maybe a month? I didn\\`t read that far, I knew what I never wanted to know and I was busy crying. \n\nThe question now is: what do I do? Should I tell her I know? I have been trying stay away from her, as I can¬¥t even look her in the eye and I don\\`t like it when she touches me. Though this (and my knowledge of what she has done) has hurt our relationship quite badly, as we are normally really close. \n\nShould I tell my Dad? I don¬¥t think that they have an open marriage, as my dad is quite conservative (and they have been having problems for a couple of years, I kind of expected them to get a divorce at some point, as they have been talking about going into counselling. Them having a \"clean\" divorce would be sad, but I could deal with that. But her cheating on my Dad and not telling anyone and just carrying on like nothing happened? It sucks.). I just feel so bad that she is cheating on him an he (probably) doesn¬¥t know. On the other hand, if I tell him, what will happen then? He will probably divorce her (?) and then it would be kind of my fault for having broken our family (I know I wasn\\`t the one who betrayed anyone, but still...). \n\nI could also tell my sister, we are normally quite close, though she has moved away for her masters degree and I don\\`t know if I want her to be in the same situation I am now. I feel horrible, angry at my Mum, sorry for my Dad and so scared that this will change everything. \n\nI know it would help me to talk to her, but I don¬¥t want to hurt her. Though at some point it is probably going to come out, when I tell her then that I knew in advance, she probably won\\`t be happy with me. Should I ask her if she generally would want to know stuff like that? \n\nI hope my Mum will make a decision and either end her affair or her marriage on her own, as this situation (knowing but nor being able to talk to anyone) is negatively affecting my mental heath, especially with christmas and all the \"family time\" associated with it coming up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you guys for listening to my rant, I would really love any advice you have and I will try to answer as many comments as I can!"

But with me he does nothing except when someone is talking negatively about my work even something small he has to chime in. The other coworkers are cool/nice with me but then when they see he doesn‚Äôt like me they are quick to throw me under the bus or agree with him.\n\nI come into work and speak to the other coworkers and pretend he doesn‚Äôt exist but he is always approaching on something. It could be a small issue and he will tell me what I did and what he had to do to correct it. Or how I misplaced something(usually something he barely uses and that everyone misplaces)and how he had to put it back. But when I need to talk to him about something he has an attitude or walks away. I even got in trouble for losing something that he took and he was present and didn‚Äôt at least say it was him that had it.\n\nFrom time to time he stares at me with some sort of side eye or nasty face.

One day he is nice and includes me but the nexts it‚Äôs back to harassing me on my mistakes. He has a boss above him. When I ask him for something to do he usually told me to ask him. His boss is super sweet and always giving me stuff to do. Most of it is somewhere away from my department so that‚Äôs nice. My boss now has disliked the fact that I don‚Äôt come up to him anymore and I take his boss more serious that I take him. It‚Äôs confusing on what to do.

We were on vacation with family so I said nothing to not cause a scene. We got home and still more of the same. Finally I confronted her about everything and of course she was defensive and said I was putting stuff in my head. Finally one afternoon we had sex, but she was still very distant her words were (come on get on top) not romance no emotion, she didn‚Äôt touch me or even showed any interest in me. In the middle of it I looked down and saw what looked like a hickey on her lower abdomen I know for a fact how hard it is to get a bruise on the abdomen. I stopped and got off of her and grabbed her phone to take a picture and asked her what the hell that was and first she said she had no idea and when I said it looked like a hickey all hell broke loose she was more mad than me and of course very defensive. I decided to shower and go to work, when I walked out of the house she again started arguing about how I had no reason to accuse her then told me she didn‚Äôt care if I came home or not. Since then more red flags and nothing but denial and defensiveness. I don‚Äôt have 100 percent proof and she will never admit any wrong doing. I know I‚Äôm stupid but only stay for my daughter.

Well my granddad has lung cancer and is in the hospital, not really in a good state. Today my dad had to go there to be with him because my granddad wasn't feeling well. I was supposed to come to my GF early today but I couldn't since my dad left and my mom feels shitty and has to take care of 3 kids (it's my moms dad that's sick). I told my GF all of this and also told her that even if I can't make it early today I will get there. When she woke up she responded to my text with \"Are you coming or not\" and i responded with \"Yeah I just told you I will be there I just can't be there early\" and she told me that she doesn't want a \"story\" about why I can't come, she just wants to know if i can or can't come. I told her this is kinda hurtful since it feels like she has no empathy, like she feels it's more important that we hang out today than how my granddad or I or anyone else feels.

I was dealing with abuse at home and in June of 2019 I ran away from home and became homeless. We had been long distance for the most part at the time but in that June I ran to the city he was in as it‚Äôs full of resources, people I knew, and a very helpful youth homelessness system. \n\nOn the bus ride up to said city he texted me and let me know he had been with another girl.. for the last year or so and that I was the other girl. While I was mad I was honestly just focusing on my survival and escaping my situation so I just didn‚Äôt care. However, 2 weeks of being in the area he came to me face to face and told me he broke up with her and he wanted to take me seriously. He had a whole speech about how he wanted to prove himself and was going to be a better person. I remember telling him that it was important to me that I don‚Äôt waste any effort since I was a homeless kid and that effort that is lost could have used elsewhere. He assured me and pushed for a second chance I decided to give it to him. \n\nIn November 2020 I got a room and finally had my own bed. He was having issues with his parents and after a week of living in my room he moved in with me. That was the last time I ever had my own bed to myself. \n\nMy partner unfortunately is undocumented (but is protected in the city we are in). In 2022 after struggling to afford rent on a 2 bedroom he wanted while also attending school full-time in one of the most expensive cities in the USA we came to a decision to get married so that we could file for his greencard and he could start helping me with living expenses. I can‚Äôt say that I was ready but we had been with each other for a long time. I saw a future with him, and we were really struggling. \n\nJust the other day we were having a conversation about my ex boyfriend (the only other person I have ever dated) from high school who reached out to me. My husband made a comment about how he was probably only reaching out to me because he was horny. I questioned him because I was honestly confused and to where that came from. He explained how most boys and men put on a facade of ‚Äúcaring‚Äù when they are really trying to get in your pants. I asked him if he ever did that and he started to back peddle. I backed him into a corner in the conversation and long story short he admitted to me that he was lying to me the first half of the relationship and only wanted to get in my pants and a big part of that was because some of his buddies wanted to get in my pants as well so ‚Äúdating‚Äù me handled both of those issues. I‚Äôm hurt and I told him so and he started to argue with me and tell while I was upset and cried because he said it was in the past and that he‚Äôs changed. \n\nI cut the conversation because I needed a break and asked my friend for advice. She couldn‚Äôt really give me any but told me she felt bad for having to say it but in that second year of us dating he asked her for nudes and told her I have him permission. She did not give him any but also didn‚Äôt want to say anything to me for my feelings. When I accused him he completely backed down and was a 180 from before. He apologized and told me he regretted his past mistakes and he understands if I break up with him. \n\nI don‚Äôt know what to do. On one hand his is my only support system and family. He is my partner and I love him, we have been together for so long and had lots of great experiences. We are married. \n\nOn the other hand I‚Äôm sad and angry. I could have used that energy elsewhere and I can‚Äôt believe he lied for so long. When I bought myself a phone I bought him one too. When I paid my phone bill I paid his too. It didn‚Äôt matter that I was homeless I put a lot of effort in many ways. I went on birth control for him since he didn‚Äôt want to wear condoms. I sacrificed and endured a lot. But looking back at it during that time I guess he really didn‚Äôt but I‚Äôm sure being homeless was a great distraction. I‚Äôm angry I only had my own bed for a week. \n\nI don‚Äôt know what to do. We are staying at a room while I look for an apartment and the goal is to then file for his greencard. I don‚Äôt know how I feel about any of it anymore. He is different now‚Äî he has to be. He even took my last name when we married and he tattooed it on himself. He‚Äôs become a more understanding and caring person and respects that I suffer from PTSD from my time being homeless. But I also cannot believe he lied for so long and then argued and got defensive when I said it hurt me. Everyone around me except for a few people are telling me to leave him. I‚Äôm not sure if I should or not and him being fully dependent on me doesn‚Äôt help. I don‚Äôt want to be a 20 year old divorcee and what if this is my last opportunity to have a partner who truly cares for me? \n\nWe have had other issues, some very serious, but this is the first one that truly am questioning if I should stay. Maybe if I wasn‚Äôt homeless when he lied I wouldn‚Äôt care as much. But I was and he was fully aware of that. \n\nPlease help, any advice is truly appreciated. I just don‚Äôt want to make the wrong choice and I‚Äôm so so scared. This is all that I know."

                "body": "\nI (18f), got diagnosed with autism at the beginning of this year. It wasn't really a shock to anyone, especially not to myself, but it still really affected my relationship with my family.\n\nEver since I was a kid, I had really bad depression, anxiety and eating issues. I always felt completely overwhelmed, and very alone and misunderstood. I remember being ten and being bullied by other kids because of how I acted (mostly related to stimming) and for being an antisocial bitch as I got older (to be clear, I was never mean, I just preferred to be by myself and didn't want to talk to people. If someone tried talking to me, I would do my best to listen and talk to them, but I wasn't very good at it). My own family made a lot of unhelpful comments about me, such as calling me difficult to my face, saying that I was never a good kid, saying that I'm \"lucky I'm smart and pretty because men will overlook my personality\". It was often in a joking manner, but it fucking hurt. I felt like who I was wasn't good enough, and that no matter what I did or how I acted, I was still an outsider and broken. I remember being twelve years old and crying myself to sleep because I convinced myself that I must be a psychopath because I react differently to social situations and \"wasn't very kind\" (my parents' words).\n\nAs I grew older, I got a lot better at masking, to the point where you couldn't tell I was autistic unless I let down my guard. I became more well liked, ESPECIALLY by my family, but they always liked to remind me I wasn't naturally kind like my brother. Hearing that always really hurt me, because I don't think I'm unkind, I just show it in different ways..\n\nWith masking, I felt far far worse than I did in childhood. I felt like I couldn't be myself, and like who I was is wrong and broken. I was constantly overstimulated but couldn't do anything to ease it. I ended up hurting myself really badly which landed me in an inpatient psych ward, where I was diagnosed with Autism (alongside other things which were a byproduct of my childhood).\n\nSince I've gotten diagnosed, things have been so much better. I don't qualify for any kind of financial aid because my family is well off, but I am finally receiving appropriate treatment. The thing that helps the most though is knowing that I'm not broken, and that I'm not actually a psychopath like I've convinced myself. I've finally allowed myself to stop masking, and life is so much easier.\n\nThe only problem? My family hates it. They think that if a person is capable of acting \"normal\" then they should. They tell me off whenever I stim. They forbid me from wearing headphones in public. They make me eat foods I'm not comfortable with, and make me eat around people. They tell me that because I could do it before my hospital stay, I should still be able to do it now. They're saying that therapy is actually making me worse, and they're threatening to stop it if I don't \"improve\".\n\nMy mum especially is really bad. She makes me feel like a failure. No matter what I do, it's not enough. I got a job to make her happy, but according to her it's \"not a real job\" and I'm \"not getting the first job experience\" whatever that means. She says that because I don't have relationships with classmates and co-workers that I'm never going to be a \"well rounded person\". She says that nobody likes a girl who'd rather sit by herself. She tells me that my degree and my grades mean nothing if I can't even \"act human\".\n\nI just don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to go forward. I have never in my life felt so happy and free, but so alone and isolated from the people I love. I don't know how to make my family understand what I'm going through. I don't know if I should go back to masking, because at least then I get my family's love.\n\nAny help or advice is really appreciated.\n\nTLDR: got an autism diagnosis and stopped masking, my family hates it.l"

Shes kind and more mature and doesnt have high sex drive than i have since i grew up mostly on the internet but now i am way mature and actually happy, although with that way of growing up i watched the hub and had a bigger knowledge of that category which played in to our intimate parts. She recently let me finger her which was somehow not as special as me and my gf thought but the day after i got a call where she said she had masturbated to me after she attempted to send a nude pic also for the first time. Somehow when i heard her talk about it i started to shake,feel ill and way more responsible for this happening. I feel as if its my fault that i affected her, i liked that she wasnt as weird and more normal as me which was the most attractive to me because i am. Every time i think about it it makes me loose my appetite or feel as if im gonna vomit. Its a totally normal thing that she has sexual cravings but i don‚Äôt like that i showed her or woke up her more sexual thoughts. I regret doing it to her, i also have in a way told her how i feel about masturbation since i dont masturbate but i dint want to be /seem so controlling.\n\nIts not about her, i know she hasnt done anything wrong, theres something wrong with me, the issue is that i think this way. Its the idea that i am affecting her and im scared of the thought that this relationship will end up like my last way more toxic relationship. Im scared of change i guess( i dont really know) im scared of changing her. Mostly for the worse. Im not saying what shes doing is bad cus it really fucking isnt and its not about masturbation, its that i feel like every change that happens in our relationship will end up being my fault, everyday i see more of myself in her, how she talks, how shes become more dirty than she was before, how she has become weird in the way i am.\n\nIm sorry if my wording is bad, english is my second language"

She said that she doesn't think its right to go on further with our relationship as she thinks her mindset is unhealthy and she needs time alone to figure out how to love herself and people properly. This all came as a surprise as I thought our relationship was good. One of the reasons she listed was that its unfair that I loved her more than she loved me.\n\nMy ex came out of a relationship in February of this year, and we started talking in April. The talking stage lasted 3 months, and all the way throughout it I specifically told her to tell me if she wasn't ready to be with me as her breakup was still fresh. She said that she's ready and properly healed. I still had my doubts about that but I decided to trust her as I had a lot of feelings for her and I was falling in love with her.\n\nShe asked me to be her girlfriend in July and I said yes. This was my first ever proper relationship, I felt very adored by her and she introduced to her whole family. At the same time I was scared of getting hurt as I know that she was previously very hurt from her last relationship. 2 months later she dropped that she loved me, i was so happy. I didn't tell her that i loved her before this because i was scared that it would come across as too full on and I didn't want to scare her.\n\nWe hung out every weekend and facetimed every other night. So you can see how the break up came as a complete shock. We did everything together. So its so weird not being with her or not texting her to see what she's up to or making plans.\n\nI don't know how to deal with a break up. I cant just remove her from my thoughts and my life. It feels like my life has no purpose as i lost the person i love. She told me that she's deeply sorry for doing this to me and that she had no intention of hurting me. I asked her why she didn't tell me that she wasn't ready to be in a relationship and she said that she really thought she was and that she thought that she thought that she could move past her struggles and give me all the love I deserve.\n\nRight now it doesn't seem like she's hurt by the breakup a whole lot though. She's acting normal on social media and hanging out with friends, and sharing it all over. Whereas I cant even hangout with my friends without feeling depressed.\n\nI texted her asking if her needing to work on herself was the only reason for breaking up the relationship and she said yes. I just find it hard to come to terms with because I wanted us to work on it together and help each other, I think that it could have been possible, but she ruled that suggestion completely out.\n\nI texted her saying that i don't want any contact anymore, as us speaking would only hurt me and remind me of the relationship we had. She wanted us to be friends after it but I said that I couldn't ever be friends with her because of our past. If I have been in a relationship with someone its so difficult just being friends with that person, because I was in love with them , its never going to be the same.\n\nShe messaged me saying that she needs a couple of weeks to sort her mind out, and when she's completely got over it then she said that we could get back together with my permission first , so she can show me the proper love that I deserve.\n\nDo i get back with her? I don't want to be hurt again by her , my friends have already advised me against this, as they said that this has happened for a good reason and that ill find someone else. I feel like I'm incapable of giving that sort of love to someone else. But then again she hurt me very badly , but her reasons are valid , so am I allowed to be mad with her?"

                "body": "I (26m) and my Fiance√© (28f) have been together for 4+ years now. When we first started dating, we we went slowly when it came to being physical. As we progressed through dating it quickly became apparent I had sexual experience and she did not. I was the first guy she had been with in years. Like a lot of girls she was/is self conscious about her body as well as her lack of experience. A lot of this stemmed from her prior relationship being emotionally abusive. Our sex life progressed slowly, step by step, and I had no qualms with it because I knew I was trying to rewrite a history of terrible experiences at best. \n\nShe wasn‚Äôt comfortable with sex at first so we just did what she was comfortable with and enjoyed being together. When she eventually was ok with sex we couldn‚Äôt physically make it work. It took us 6mo slowly progressing before we did fit together. I spent a lot of time basically pumping the brakes, insisting that she still wasn‚Äôt ready. I knew it was really important it be good for her so that sex was a good thing in her mind and not an obligation. Jamming myself in was not going to do that for her.\n\nLet it be noted that at this point I am totally infatuated with her, but she told me later on she put a lot of pressure on herself to ‚Äúmake it happen‚Äù because she was afraid of losing me. That pressure to perform is still around now I think.\n\nAs our relationship progressed a few things became apparent. Like a lot of girls, she requires a good bit of foreplay from a ‚Äúcold start‚Äù a majority of the time even when she is in the mood. No problem, I can be helpful there and I am, with a lot of slow kissing and touching to get her where she needs to be. Because she doesn‚Äôt have any experience masturbating she cannot. In fact (according to her) the only way she has ever finished is PIV. This puts a lot of pressure on me to get her warmed up and ready whenever she wants to have sex.\n\nI am not too big on receiving blowjobs and handjobs. I‚Äôm happy to, but I don‚Äôt really ask for them, and would rather just have sex. Like a lot of people she doesn‚Äôt have any love for giving them. She‚Äôs happy to whenever I ask, but it‚Äôs not something she enjoys, and so it‚Äôs not usually something that we flow into when trying to have sex if that makes sense.\n\nI LOVE going down on her. This is not a new development for me and I honestly would do it every day after work if possible. I find it very stress relieving for whatever reason, as well as being a huge turn on. She loves it and usually forces me to stop so we can get to PIV. She is very clean and tastes great, but she was self conscious and was not ok with me doing this at first. That is totally fine, but when we eventually did we both agreed sex was way better. She was more turned on, we weren‚Äôt trying to force it, etc. Lots of girls give oral before sex, and I am happy as a clam if allowed to flip the script and give it beforehand.\n\nThe problem is that she continues to be stop and go about it being ok, entirely as a self-conscious thing. She always enjoys it, but it‚Äôs the allowing me to do it bit we get stuck on. Even when things are totally fine she will still cancel on me going out to eat at the last second. That‚Äôs her right. \n\nThe problem is that for us to have sex I have to get her started up. If I can‚Äôt munch I have to finger her. It feels really impersonal and I hate it because I spend the whole time trying to do 3 things at once and hoping I don‚Äôt do anything wrong, because otherwise the whole thing is off. It‚Äôs stressful, and there‚Äôs a lot of pressure on me to get her to a place where she can have sex, because she can‚Äôt do any of this for herself. If I‚Äôm not doing it we will not go anywhere. I get it‚Äôs because of the relative lack of experience and not a lack of enthusiasm, and I think she is improving for what it‚Äôs worth. Maybe sometime soon she will be able to get herself to the right place physically.\n\nIt‚Äôs all started coming to a head recently. We‚Äôll be agreed to have sex. As things progress I‚Äôll offer to head south and she will stop me. I then continue touching her until we hopefully get to a point where we can have PIV. The whole thing is starting to feel very robotic, and I feel like I‚Äôm putting in all the work for her to try and orgasm or even have PIV. If I could just go down on her I would be able to enjoy the process of getting her there, but the other route feels like clocking in for a shift. If I don‚Äôt do my job people are visibly disappointed. Today I just threw in the towel when she said no to oral and decided to pass on sex entirely instead of going through all that work and pressure. She got angry at me, but I‚Äôm at my wits end. I‚Äôm trying to be as supportive as possible, and I know you can‚Äôt just decide to be less self conscious, but it‚Äôs like a dice roll as to whether I can or can‚Äôt. If I‚Äôm going to have to provide all the foreplay I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a huge ask to get to enjoy it. I don‚Äôt want to strong-arm her but somehow I‚Äôm here. How do I get us to a more healthy sex life?"

We wanted this Christmas to be special and full of traditions to start on our own and to just overall make our first Christmas memorable.\n\nI put lots of thought into his present that included his favorite cologne (the kind he wore for our wedding) stuff for his hobbies he has wanted for a while, and some NFL apparel he has had his eye on. I, in the past tried to give him subtle hints to what I want for any kind of gift for whatever occasion, and he never seems to get the hint, so I just have to tell him straight up what I would like. This year, he wanted to try to do it all on his own without me telling him what I would like. I did hint and show him  before that I would like this locket I found so I can put one of our wedding pictures in it and it is something I could wear everyday for my job since it was so small and simple. He said he would keep that in mind, but would keep looking.\n\nNow to yesterday. I was snowed in my house for 4 days due to a blizzard and I had extra time on my hands, so I decided to do some deep cleaning around the house. As I was cleaning I came upon a box I assumed was jewelery from the wedding and it turned out to be my gift from my husband. It was a BIG, CHUNKY necklace with different colored jewels in it to look like the infinity gauntlet from Marvel and there was a separate coin looking thing that said \"I Love You 3000\".\n\nI am a Marvel fan and that is something me and my husband love to watch and I get the meaning behind it, but I just do not like the necklace with how big and colorful it is and I am not much of a jewlery wearing person to begin with. I don't want to hurt his feels because I know he put lots of thought and love into it, but I would never wear it and I don't want to break his heart. I have been up all night thinking about the necklace and how hurt I would make him if I told him I hated it. \n\nDo I suck it up, say I love it, and never wear it or wear it every now and then, or do I tell him the truth?"

                "body": "I'd like some opinions on a situation that's surfaced recently, if only to tell me that I'm reading too much into it. \n\nFirst some background: \n\nMy GF (34F) and I (50M) met back in July, (keep your age gap comments.  You'd never guess i was older than 40 if you saw me) and we hit it off right away.  She generally spends a night or two per week at my house, and a couple of weekends per month.   She lives an hour from me, and my place is closer to her work )normally 1.5 hr drive), so it makes sense that she comes here. \n\nWe've been very transparent with our pasts, and communicate really well. I know that she's been in same sex relationships in the past, and she knows that I'm a long time widower, and a serial bachelor who's seen my share of short trusts and one-night-stands.  I'm usually 3-5 years between LTRs.  \n\nThe situation:\n\nA few weeks ago, she told me that she was going out with friends on Friday night, but she didn't know where; it was a surprise.  She said she wanted to come to my place afterward, so she didn't have to drive back to her town, and back the next morning, as we had plans for Saturday.  No problem with me.  She has a key.  \n\nShe told me that she'd keep me updated on their evening (she volunteered this. I didn't ask) and shoot me a text when she was on the way.  \n\nI didn't hear from her, or see her that night.  It was noon the following day, and she wasn't going to make it for our plans.  When I asked her what happened to her coming by - the answers were so vague that I don't even remember what she said.  I just remember realizing that she was actively avoiding a clear answer.  I dropped it, but there was an orange flag that went up.  \n\nFast forward a few weeks, and she was going through her Facebook and showed me a picture of a woman, and said: \"That's who I went to the hockey game with, the night I was supposed to come to your house.\"\n\nI asked about the rest of the group, because she didn't say \"one of the girls, I went with.\"  She said it was just the 2 of them.   I picked up my phone and went back through my texts, and saw where she claimed several times that it was 4 or 5 of them.  Yellow flag, but nothing worth picking at. \n\nNow, we come to 2 nights ago, when she came over after work and spent the night.   Her phone rang 4 times while she was in the shower, and then vibrated for what felt like the entire night.  I get up at 4am every morning, and it was vibrating when I woke up.  I told her that her phone had blown up all night and she might want to check it.  \n\nYesterday afternoon we were talking during her drive home, and she mentioned the calls and texts. She said it was the gal that she went to the hockey game with.  She told me the woman was drunk and belligerent, sending her shitty text messages and voicemails, sending her pictures of being outside her house, and just being (in her words) a douche. \n\nI said: \"This woman thinks you're together as a couple.\"  She didn't confirm or discount the theory; simply played it off as a nothing burger. \n\nSo Reddit, this is my thinking:  The other woman took my girlfriend to dinner and hockey.  She's a gay woman who by my gf's own account, has expressed interest in her before.  They hang out a lot since they live in the same little town.  \n\nI think that either:\n\n 1. She is reading more into their \"date\", than my gf is, or \n\n2. there's something brewing on the side.  \n\nMy GF swears that she has no interest in the other woman (she's pretty large) and in gf words, definitely not her type.  \n\nI can't help but have this nagging feeling in the back of my mind that the reason she didn't come by or keep me updated that night, was because things got frisky and they had themselves a tryst; gf decided it wasn't for her/was a big mistake and has been avoiding the situation by spending a lot more time with me, instead of being at home. \n\nAm I reading too much into this, or did she step out? \n\nTLDR: Bi GF went out with a gay woman, and I think she may have cheated that night."

So I am (23y) girl and I am in this country 3 years and I am with my boyfriend (30y) since 1 year and I feel so disappointed of our relationship. He promised me love to death since begging and after 3 months of being together he promised me being engaged on anniversary. When I was waiting and our relationship was developing, I change my work I started the Uni half an year ago and on past month we had anniversary therefore I was skint I bought him a gift for 4 weeks of shortage on my food (hello I am student with part time job and he is working full-time) and he gave me small cactus. That will be awful what I will say and I shouldn‚Äôt do it but my boyfriend any single time helped me when I was complaining that I have empty fridge, and I am starving and I told him not once about my financial problems, also we discovered that he want to have possibility to send dicpic and he sometimes like anal and for me this is disgusting. And we were talking about it and he stopped be pushy for me on this kind of things. I just started to feel tired because we weren‚Äôt go out by ages even when we were working together. Also on this time when I was on Uni I put whole my frustration (relationship frustration, life frustration, work frustration) on being prepared on the Uni and to be active on the lectures, but one lecturer had taken it wrong because I just wanted to have fun on the seminars and just give from myself 1000%. So my lecturer offered me a meeting, with context ‚ÄúI have a fun with seminars with you because you are one of the strongest student in group. Would you like to meet on Christmas time? We can talk that can be something else‚Ä¶‚Äù\nDon‚Äôt understand me wrong, he didn‚Äôt touch me, but just ask me like this. I started to be confused and this situation overwhelmed me so I didn‚Äôt say anything and after the moment of quietness he told me: ‚Äúleave me a email if you would like to spend some time on Christmas together because I suppose you are alone in UK‚Äù (one of mine Uni mate told him that) And again don‚Äôt understand me wrong because everyone has a right to looking for a partner but how can I gently say him no? I am not in mental condition for that therefore his intellect imposes me. I don‚Äôt know how to behave should I wait to end of Christmas and talk with him after the Christmas break? Or should I send him mail or should I don‚Äôt react?\nTo be honest I had a moment to consider his proposition and think ‚Äúif I were‚Ä¶ I would..‚Äù and that make me feel like human garbage."

I was grateful.But things between us was getting intense.we se*ted and it was unbelievably good.i wanted to keep things this way only.\n\nWe both agreed we could've dated if we  were in same country.But I was getting emotionally attached to him day by day because of his constant love and care.I needed someone like him in my life. All the words he said was full of care. \n\nThen the time came when I felt I was showing more interest in his life than him in my life. I couldn't master the courage to ask cz I'm not his partner .I was upset about it and somehow he understood that.He told me there had been a change in his work schedule that's why he was busier than before.i told him it's ok. It happened like 4/5 times and the same excuse.Still I was fine with it.\n\nNow-a- days I watch him being online at night and he doesn't initiate the convo. I'm not saying always he has to text first.But he did all these months.Then I texted first after fighting my ego(cz I wait the whole day for talking to him as he is busy during day)If I text \"hey\" ,the reply is only \"hey\".not a letter after that.and all the time, he is online.\n\nI thought about not continuing this any more but it's getting hard for me.feels like he's losing interest in me.feels like I'm being neglected.\nWhat do guys think about it? Can I get any advice? U can ask anything more"

So they began to \"rant\" shit about her to other people until it spread to our class. And I was the one who told Amy that she was being backstabbed and she was upset of course. I was also upset with our friend group. Because why would you talk behind the back of your friend you know? So I also left that friend group but still talk to those not related to the issue. \n\nAnd another reason I left is that they also talked shit about another friend from before, telling me that she was a show-off (like showing off her rank in a game) Which I asked the other friend about. And she said that she only did it once. they also talked about her spoild-ness which I didn't see in her or just didn't notice. \n\nAnd yea they were pretty toxic I think. And now Amy is now talking to our friend group again but she told me they didn't trust them anymore. I think she forgave them a little.

We enjoy that much with cocktails and foods. When we head out, I was the only woman who's the farthest transpo terminal, let alone destination. \nOne of my colleagues volunteered to walk me at the station.\nHe even carried all my stuff and the grand prize I got at the raffle. When we got at the station, to our surprise, there's no single means of transportation. We sat by the station's bench and stayed there for about an hour. \nIt was dewy, the rain was hard and he's not getting the hang of his drunkenness. Mas may tama sya sakin and even puked. \nI called my bff coz she knows a lot about the city. She just suggested to check-in. I thought I can't just leave him there since I was the reason he walked far from his station. So I waited for the colleague to come to his senses.\nWhen he does, I asked him gently if we can check-in and I highlighted: \"no any intentions\".\nHe agreed with me.\nThe nearest hotel was SOGO T-T \nObviously, there's only one bed and the light was red.\nI open the door in the shower for the light and changed the room's light theme.\nWe look like we just moved in at apartment because of our baggages. I still address him 'Sir'.\nNothing happened naman. I put a pillow between us. I even wore my coat. We just had a long conversation about him being bullied by his superior. He was gentle naman but since he was drunk I could sense his clinginess which I avoid. I push him gently on the other side and tell him na we got boundaries. And after that, he stopped doing it. \nTo brush off the thought na I'm with a man in a room, I always brought up my boyfriend. All my topic was dearly about my partner. How much I learned from him. Na he respects and loves me. To remind myself din na I am my man's woman.\n\nMalinis naman conscience ko, pero idk. I was cheated on dati sa ex ko and now I feel like I kinda tolerated some situation to happen.

We're having a wonderful time together thus far, but one thing I still find hard is playing video games with him.\n\nI'm a casual gamer and I really only like to play comfy games like Minecraft or Cooking Mama, and some rhythm games here and there. I'm also a bit of an overachiever and a perfectionist. My boyfriend on the other hand, he's a little more of the laid-back type and he loves to play video games. He knows a lot of video games I don't, so I take great joy when he tells me all about the games he plays. \n\nNaturally, he'd also want to play some of those games with me. Now, the problem here is that I get terrible anxiety whenever we play some together. \n\nOnce, we agreed that we'd play a harder game instead of the usual Minecraft we always do. He guided me through the tutorial and everything, but I think that despite his good intentions, I just kept getting more nervous. He's pretty good at this game too, to add to my anxiety. I wanted to be able to keep up with him, but I was really confused with all the movements and controls and menus that all felt really foreign to me. I was panicking when the enemies came, and I was fumbling with the controls because I wasn't used to it. He tried to coach me on how to kill the enemies, but the panic was too much and I ended up dying.\n\nThe experience was so bad for me that I got anxiety poops, which I have never gotten except for situations like these. It's already happened before, so this would be the second time.\n\nI already talked about it with him, and he's really been nothing but sweet and supportive. Though, I really want to get better at handling my game-related anxiety on my own, so I could hopefully surprise him? Either way, I want to be able to play games with him and share in the things he loves.\n\nI'm wondering if there's anything I can do to help my anxiety? Are there any games that a beginner like me can play to work towards some harder games? Any advice would be appreciated.

I also saw her, because she was constantly looking for me, she would come in an hour before to see me, etc. She began to tell me to meet, and like \"whenever you want\", \"wherever you want\", \"I'm going to look for you\" with a lot of desire. Soon we met, we went to dinner and then we spent the night together; I interpreted that it went very well; In fact, I don't know, she wanted to leave, she wanted to stay with me, but I had to work. Until there everything seemed perfect. In fact, in a later discussion, she told me that she had a great time when we met and she was delighted.

When talking about the subject it was impossible to get anything out of him, that he does think I'm very hot, that he likes me and such.\nA week ago I left for another job and asked him more thoroughly. She told me after insisting again after many months, that she was comfortable with me but that she knew that for a fuck she was not going to be the woman of my life.

She hasn't pushed me away or anything. Another guy comes in which she apparently likes but barely gives attention. Where do I go from here????\n\n---------\n\n(very) Long version\n\nSo I met this wonderful woman last year at a party and I enjoyed their company so much that I followed them up afterwards so we would stay in contact.  As the year progresses we get closer and closer, start spending lots of time together and even text eachother almost every single day. It was like we had known eachother for years - I had developed a bit of a crush. At this point I was unsure if this was developing into a relationship or some sort of best friends situation.\n\nThen came that one night... We were out with some of her other friends having a few drinks until one of them goes \"you don't wanna have too many, don't want to ruin your date tomorrow\". My heart sank. Up until this moment I thought if anything I would be the guy with an opportunity to ask her out not this guy that she \"kinda likes\" (her words).\n\nSo I panicked. I took her to the side and I told her how I felt - I could not hold back the tears, neither could she. I was a bit too dazed to remember everything but I do exactly remember that she said \n\"you are one of best people I've met, I love you as a friend and I wouldn't want to ruin that\" - I had not even mentioned love. We hugged and cried for like another 10mins and then we walked home together. I can't think of other moments in my life where I have felt that much pain.\n\nFast forward to now (3 months have passed) and it's as if nothing has happened. We still spend time togwther and talk routinely like before - she hasn't pushed me away like other women probably would after an event like that.\n\nNow the other guy... At a party, I overheard a conversation this guy had about this woman with his friend. TLDR he said that he was \"keeping his options option\" and that he was \"40% on the interested scale\". In short this pissed me off.\n\n.He does not actively spend time with the woman \n. I have seen him off giving other women undivided  attention whilst the woman of interest is around\n. He has had multiple parties where she has not been invited for some odd reason \n. The guy will straight up say bye to everyone but her when leaving a party\n\netc etc - he does not really act like someone that is interested\n\nOn top of this she keeps giving me significantly more attention when both me and the guy are around. But but does she still 'like' him? Yes, according to a conversation where she was speaking a bit too loud. Now I'm just very confused.\n\nOverall, I'm still not over her. I'm shell shocked and I'm probably damaging myself physiologically by thinking about her constantly. My confused ass is willingly driving a nail into my foot hoping for the chance of this guy not doing anything, resulting in her running to me. How do I continue cus I honestly have no clue????!?!\n\nP.S.\nThere are probably details missing otherwise this thing would be 3x as long. Think the important stuff is there but feel free to ask for clarification"

Every time I message her I get a reply instantly, even if I took hours and sometimes days for me to respond. Sometimes I won‚Äôt respond and she‚Äôll start a new conversation just to talk to me. I have suspicions that she‚Äôs looking for someone new, and has found people she‚Äôs interested in\n\nMy question is why would she still care to reply instantly and start conversations with me if this is the case? Maybe I‚Äôm misreading the situation and my lack of conversation makes her think I‚Äôm not interested anymore? Any advice is welcomed. Thank you"

                "body": "We were just talking about the first time we had sex last year, and she told me that she felt like we shouldn‚Äôt have done it earlier (third date) since it made her feel insecure about the way I see her. She added that it didn‚Äôt feel organic as chemistry wasn‚Äôt there, and she didn‚Äôt want me to feel that she‚Äôs easy to get.\n\nThis baffled me because (1) we were calling each other for hours every day prior to the first time we had sex and I felt like we were building great chemistry/connections through deep conversations, and (2) she told me stories about her sleeping on first dates in the past - especially that one fling with this doctor who was apparently really arrogant and annoying but nonetheless invited him to sleep with her after a brief lunch together because she was horny.\n\nSo when asked about whether she sees sex as something more casual, she answers yes. I then ask, ‚Äúif that‚Äôs the case, shouldn‚Äôt it be okay for us to have done it earlier, especially since we had established feelings/connections prior?‚Äù - she then replies she didn‚Äôt feel any of the connections that I felt during our initial meetup and daily ritual calls as an intimate vibe, and concludes with ‚Äúyou are a boyfriend material‚Äù excuse. \n\nThis hit me hard, because when we started our relationship a year ago, she had just broken up with her ex a couple of months before and she still missed him backed then. The first few months with her were rough for me because I felt like I was being constantly compared with her ex - she would tell me how he was a better ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù and I‚Äôm a better ‚Äúpartner‚Äù.\n\nTo her, a boyfriend is someone who can make her happy by doing romantic things, and partner is someone who can make her feel safe and secure. To be fair, I‚Äôm not much of a romantic person in a materialistic way like showering gifts and going on fancy dates, but I don‚Äôt know how I feel about this relationship not being primarily based on romantic feelings towards each other. Though to her defense, her feelings have grown and matured over time.\n\nLately, I‚Äôve been having the urge to just break up with her, since I feel like she‚Äôs simply settling with me because I‚Äôm ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. Our conversation about our first sexual experience really didn‚Äôt make me feel better about the whole situation either. Am I just being narrow minded here? Really curious to hear from others‚Äô perspective on this one."

I‚Äôm his first ‚Äúreal‚Äù girlfriend cause he had a ton of short relationships due to the fact that he moved so much and served in the military.  Everything started off fine. He was charming and charismatic. On our first date, he taught me how to dance. We have a lot in common, but when it comes to getting personal I kinda quiver. First is he talks about moving in two years so much when it‚Äôs so far down the line. Its like he‚Äôs putting an end date to us and has no plans to compensate.He has a vasectomy and he is anti family which kinda bothers me cause I might want kids in the future. He told me when I was already attached. He had a bad past with his family so I understand. Later on he came out that he doesn‚Äôt believe in marriage and doesn‚Äôt want the legal things that come with it. He said it‚Äôs signing off your freedom/rights to a woman if we divorce, he‚Äôd be fucked. I brought up signing a prenup, but he didn‚Äôt budge. I know it‚Äôll be a while from now if we ever get there, but it makes me question. Next are his political views and wokness, it brings out another side of him. He likes to talk about it a lot and gets irritated when I don‚Äôt give input. He then brags about what happened in class and critiques everything about his class.  He talks about how it‚Äôs always the class bs him. Everything always has to go his way. Once we walked MY dog and I wanted to bring his harness to walk with him and he insisted not to and shoved it back at me. That happens a lot in situations. Where I say I don‚Äôt want something to happen and he does it anyway. I also have a couple of guy friends and he gets angry when I talk to them. I‚Äôve been friends with them for years. We had an argument when he saw one of them text me and he said ‚Äúwell I guess I‚Äôll just redownload tinder and talk to girls then‚Äù he didn‚Äôt do it and apologized, but that kinda screams controlling to me  Then comes the food. I don‚Äôt care if a guy doesn‚Äôt buy me things, but he used to buy all the food that we cook with. Now we take two separate carts to the mall and check out separately, yet I cook all the food at my place using my gas and electricity. It‚Äôs the fact that he used to do it and doesn‚Äôt do it anymore, what changed?A while bsck he preached about how a woman should never buy a man things, but he asked me to buy him some drinks from the store and said he‚Äôd get me back but never did. He also had to borrow my toilet plunger because he doesn‚Äôt have one. Last night he preached to me about how I‚Äôm the best girlfriend, but I just don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm getting anything. The man has over 100k saved up, but when it comes to thingshe‚Äôs cheap. All he spends it on are dance classes and driving to other areas. We all have our own passions, but am I being irrational? How should I go on about this?"

He has travelled around the world and met friends off of it). So I understood him and instead we found a middle ground where we deactivate our Tinder accounts instead so he keeps his memories. However, thinking he was so secure about it, I asked if he could open his most recent chat and he did without hesitation. Once opened it showed that he matched with someone on the 1st of December. I was taken back by this and felt shocked. He was also just as shocked and reassured me that it must have been a technical error or someone he swiped ages ago and they swiped him back recently so the match happened then. \n\nA part of me believes that this is indeed what happened, that he swiped this person ages ago and they swiped him recently.

It's genuinely really frustrating. I dream about being in a really sweet relationship, and I always get so jealous when I see a TikTok of a cute couple trend, or I see my friends and their significant other being all cuddly. And when I have been presented with the opportunity, I get excited for one second, but then I get super anxious about it and want nothing to do with the relationship.   \n\n\nAnother strange detail I've noticed, is I'm more anxious about being in a relationship when I have first woken up, whether it's in the morning, or from a midday nap. Over the past year, I've gotten to know a friend of my best friend, who I never met in person, but was told he thought I was super cute. So after that, we became friendly on Instagram and would flirt briefly from time to time. Over this last week, he visited my state and we all hung out together, and during a party, we got a little tipsy and became super flirty and cuddly, and held hands throughout the night. The next day, and the remaining days that he was here, I felt super awkward doing anything remotely romantic or close to him. I felt so awful, because I do really like him, and over text, we still flirted. He told me I was one of the prettiest girls he's ever seen and it had me blushing and kicking my feet and twirling my hair. And that night I felt like I could toy with the idea of being in a relationship with a guy if he didn't live in another state. But then the next morning, I got anxious about it, even though there is not even a possibility of being in a relationship with him, at least not right now. But later in the evenings, I'm more open to the idea.   \n\n\nI have also realized that the more people tease me over a possible relationship, or make a big deal about it, the LESS I wanna be in it.   \n\n\nWHY do I have anxiety over relationship stuff and intimate stuff when I've just woken up, and sometimes just, in general? And do you think I have commitment issues? Or am I aromantic and I just don't really realize it? OR MAYBE IM JUST REALLY YOUNG! but it FEELS like a lot of people my age have already figured this out, and I'm scared I will never find love because of the way I feel LOL.

He sent me flowers and gifts and we fell in love. Every so often we would video call and they would last for about 6 hours at a time.

On Facebook I saw photos of them at a wedding in august of 2022 and she was wearing her engagement ring. I messaged her and asked and she told me they have never broken up not even for a second. They also just moved into an apartment together about 2 weeks ago. He immediately deleted every social media account he had.

My girlfriends stance on this is, if I really cared about her and loved her, I would suck it up.

She expects me to move in Q1 or else we would have to break up after 2 years. She even goes so far to suggest that we might as well break up now, in case I am unwilling to commit to this long ass commute 3x week, because it shows her that I am unwilling to compromise and apparently don't love her. \n\nI am hugely disappointed in the way my GF is responding to this situation and giving me these ultimatums while being irrational about it.

She only told me that after two years, we should make plans to move in together. Welp, here we are now after two years but instead of figuring out a plan with my GF,  I am faced with this ultimatum."

This is a throwaway account and I would rather that my wife (and her family and friends) not be able to find this account.\n\nMy wife, whom I still love despite everything listed below, is a chronic alcoholic, suffers from extreme clinical depression that in the past has included suicidal ideation, and I believe is also suffering from undiagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder. It is quite possible there are additional comorbidities. Unfortunately, after years of sobriety, my wife has again started drinking to excess, and while she is not difficult 24/7, she is frequently very controlling and has become verbally and emotionally abusive to me, particularly when she is waking up or falling asleep. I believe this is when she is the most unfiltered, and if that is accurate, then yikes. \n\nShe is unable to care for herself or her elderly cat, who needs special attention to continue to thrive. I am terrified that he will be neglected or compromised or will suffer an early death if I leave the house. She adores him and would not let anything happen to him, but alcohol right now is her only best friend and I worry that she is unable to feed him or give him meds on his own. And I love the little guy too and he's been a part of our family since forever. And while I might be forced to leave her because of her abusive behavior, the cat is innocent and I really want to stay to take care of him until he passes. \n\nIf I take the cat with me, any possibility of an amicable separation is over. She will come after me until the end of time if I take him with me. Plus, I'd be depriving him of her company in his last years and vice versa and I cannot live with that. I cannot take the one thing she loves most away from her.\n\nAs far as I know, she has no idea that I am at the end of my rope. I am trying desperately to help her,  but she hasn't eaten anything for three days and is barfing on herself. I cannot take care of her in this state. She is basically an invalid and I am not physically or mentally capable of being her home health nurse.\n\nSo I can't take care of her, I can't leave her, and she's abusing me. Great, huh? \n\nIn addition, she hasn't worked for ten years. I have supported us myself. She has been less frequently abusive when not drinking, but the abuse is still there. It is not physical abuse. With her drinking again, I have to do almost everything. She pays some of the online bills and he credit card off and that's about it. I pay for all the other bills, I do shopping, cleaning, vacuuming, garbage, feed the cat, empty kitty litter, nearly everything.\n\n0/10 would not recommend. \n\nI must also say that when she is lucid, she is very, very sweet most of the time towards me, and I genuinely believe she is not a malevolent person.  Her behavior is from mental illness I think.\n\nWhat do I do?"

                "body": "Earlier this year I (33M) got out of an extremely toxic relationship with a girlfriend (31F) of 11 years who abused me mentally and physically and cheated on me. We have 2 kids and she essentially abandoned them after the breakup for heroin & crack cocaine, leaving me as a single dad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA few months ago I got in a new relationship with a girl (23F) who seemed to tick a lot of boxes. She is absolutely drop-dead gorgeous and works as a professional model, so there is a lot of physical chemistry. She treats my kids like they are her own, despite not having any kids of her own. She is super supportive of me, says a lot of things which raise my self esteem, and has never been toxic with me. I enjoy hanging out with her and we laugh a lot together, she cooks & cleans, gets on with my friends & family, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe's also the first women I've had amazing sex with since my ex. We have sex 2-5 times per day and I can barely keep up, and she always wants to try new and exciting things like making porn together to post anonymously online, doing BDSM and other random kinks, having 3somes with other women, etc. I slept with a number of girls in-between these relationships where the sexual chemistry was disappointing. I've always been a pretty sexually adventurous guy and so a sexual connection is a very important part of a relationship for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe moved in with me after a month of dating and we've been living together since. We haven't had any arguments and she is constantly telling me how much she loves me and how I'm her perfect guy, everything she's been looking for, etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe one major downside is that her financial expectations are very high. Before we got in a relationship she made it very clear that she expects men she dates to \"look after her\", so I consented to the situation of basically paying for her lifestyle. Her last 2 ex-boyfriends were both extremely rich, and she always has a lot of rich guys chasing her through her work as a model.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI did some accounting and the cost of dating her is around $20,000 per month (in US dollars, we live in London). She has a mortgage on a property overseas of around $6000 USD, buys designer clothing, and then there's dates at expensive restaurants and hotels, and travel. So in total it costs about $240K/yr to date her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can afford this because I'm wealthy, but it's still a LOT of money and actually even more than I spend on myself and my 2 kids each month combined, even after factoring in things like nannies and cleaners.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough I love her, in the back of my mind it definitely feels like I'm in a classic \"rich guy hot girl\" gold digger relationship. She says she loves me back and her actions and behaviour are congruent with this, but there's obviously no way she would be dating me if I was poor. The financial expectations in the relationship are making me feel insecure in whether it's true love or weather I'm wrapped up in some kind of superficial fantasy and deluding myself about the strength of our connection, which leaves me feeling a little insecure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've been thinking this week about maybe breaking up with her and looking for a women without these kinds of expectations, but I'm really torn because I how can I resent her for a situation where the expectations were something I consented to at the start. The kids have grown close to her and I know it would hurt them a lot to have her disappear. It would also upset me a lot and it will probably be hard to find a new woman I have the same level of chemistry with. I've never had problems finding women to date or sleep with, but it's rare to find a serious level of chemistry with women I meet as she is by far the most beautiful women I've been with in a long time. I definitely feel that if I break up with her it's going to hurt a lot.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAny advice or insights from the subreddit is greatly appreciated. Thanks"

It‚Äôs what we both want and it has been this way since we started dating. Unfortunately, my kid has been really sick this week, so I wasn‚Äôt able to make it to the party. When I mentioned I probably couldn‚Äôt go to my boyfriend last night and suggested he go alone, he was adamant about not going. He said he would never go to a club without me and that we are all a family and in this together, so if I can‚Äôt go, he won‚Äôt. \n\nToday, he texted me and said his friend asked him if he was going. I asked him what he wanted to do and he said ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll call him and say we can‚Äôt because you have your daughter‚Äù. Kinda sounded like he still wanted to go, even though he told me otherwise. He came home from work and seemed really bothered by something. We laid on the bed for like 5 minutes and I asked him multiple times what was bothering him. He said he was just tired but I knew that wasn‚Äôt true. He tends to bottle things up and then blow up and spit it out during fights. He then said ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm going to call my friend now and tell him our kids are sick‚Äù. He called him, then hung up the phone and stuck it in his pocket and went in the living room to watch tv. This is unlike him. He always watches tv in the bedroom with me when he comes home. It was also odd that he kept his phone in his pocket because he never does that. He always leaves it out. I knew he wasn‚Äôt going to speak up about what he was feeling, so I just stood in the bedroom. \n\nI felt super disappointed though. I was off work today, so I decided to go get a haircut in the exact way he likes, I made sure to come home, style my hair and do my makeup and I even bought some lingerie to wear for him later on. I waited ALL DAY to be with him and lay next to him while he rested. When he came in the room after waking up from a nap, he noticed I was bothered by something so asked what was wrong. I explained it bothered me that he didn‚Äôt want to lay with me like he always does and that I thought it was weird he kept his phone in his pocket. He responded ‚Äúoh you can‚Äôt be serious? everything bothers you! You‚Äôre so stupid! I‚Äôm done with you! All you do is complain!!!!‚Äù  I follow him around the house like a pathetic girl as he‚Äôs packing asking him not to leave, feeling emotional, upset and angry all at once. He tells me I‚Äôm crazy for crying, playing the victim and yelling. He was very cold and mean. He told me he‚Äôs sick of me and doesn‚Äôt want to be with me anymore, so I walked out of the room without another word and let him leave (he was in sweats and only packed pajamas and a toothbrush so I know he didn‚Äôt go out). He always leaves to his parents during fights and he always says things like this when we fight. \n\nAt this point it‚Äôs getting old. I‚Äôm 37 and want to be married. I want stability. I‚Äôm attractive, loyal, and loving. I have lots to offer. Somehow, I need to be strong. Somehow I need to be ok. How? I always end up feeling guilty after every fight. Tonight I told him I felt abandoned by him leaving and he responded ‚Äúif you were that afraid of being abandoned then maybe you‚Äôd act right‚Äù. I just want to be strong and I don‚Äôt want to feel hurt and blame myself for everything."

                "body": "I started dating my ex (22M) when I (21F) had just gotten done with high school. He said he didn't want anything serious and that whatever we had was purely physical and just a fling. We both ended up catching feelings fairly quickly and I wanted to talk about it. He on the other hand, wanted to pretend that there were no feelings and that everything was going according to his plans. He was going into the military and didn't want to try and navigate the complexity of having a new relationship while being in the military. I understood but this was still extremely difficult for me. I had fallen hard. After he went into the military I wrote tons of letters, I waited for him to come home, and frankly I would've done just about anything he would've asked me to do, which he seemed to be pleased with. \n\nAll the while this was happening, I was putting in significantly more effort on my end to show I cared and came to the realization that it was also unfair of him to expect me to wait around for him if he would not make a commitment to me. This man has never ever called me a girlfriend or anything. Never took me on dates, we always just hung out doing whatever he wanted to do. At at his friends houses, running his errands, etc. I felt used for my body. I knew this was wrong and I deserved better but despite knowing that I still chose to be with him because I was in love with him. It hurt me a lot. It made me question my value and I cried frequently about it. He never gave me any gifts and I remember the valentines day we had spent together we went to the local diner and then went to pick up some stuff he bought off craigslist. This is just one example of many times things like this have happened. I'm not high maintenance by any means but this hurt a lot and I knew/know I deserve better. \n\nAfter about 9 months of him being in the military he was discharged (taken out of the military) and sent home. This was another very emotional milestone. He was feeling extremely rejected as this was his life goal while I on the other hand thought that maybe this meant that he would stop holding back and maybe decide he did want to be with me and could stop putting up this front to block his romantic feelings. Things.... slightly improved. We saw each other a little more but it was all the same otherwise. Hanging out with his friends, doing his chores, on his time. Shortly after being discharged from the military he for unrelated reasons had to move over 1000 miles (approx 1609 km) away across the country. This put us both through extreme emotional whiplash. Thoughts were \"Oh, he's getting discharged, maybe he and I can be together now without his emotional reservations in the way\" to about 2 months later being like \"well nevermind he is moving across the country.\"\n\nWe are both young and I couldn't handle it emotionally. (Keep in mind I was 18-19 through all this.) I fully understand and agknowledge that what he was going through with the rejection of the military (his dream) that he was going through extreme emotional discomfort and pain as well. All that being said, I knew this man was not good to me. Throughout the duration of the relationship, friends and family kept emphasizing that this was toxic and that I shouldn't be entertaining it. Offering me resourses if i needed help, etc. My answer was the same to all of them. \"This is toxic. I'm aware. I am choosing to be with him and that is that\" I know it was not wise but the head and the heart are not always in sync. He ended up moving the 1000+ miles. I remember saying at the time \"this is terrible but it is the best thing that could've happened because otherwise I would still be choosing to be with him\"\n\nIt has been approx a year and a half since his big move. He is lonely where he is now. Not many friends and no girls, only the blue collar guys he works with. I on the other hand, have frankly been flourishing. I am doing well in my social life, exploring other romantic avenues and have moved on. About 6 months ago (about a year after his big move) He told me that he wildly fucked up. He told me that he was hopelessly in love with me and was going to save up to move back to be with me. I can see that he has changed. I really can. I see the effort he is putting forth and that he really is sorry he took me for granted. That being said, it does not warrant me getting back together with him. I told him I will not date long distance. Although this was said I still feel some unspoken pressure that he wants me to wait for him and be chaste since he made this confession to me. I have been dating and seeing other guys. I beleive he has a vague awareness of this but we don't talk about it. I've moved on emotionally and don't know how to handle this constant affection from him. Despite everything, he still means a lot to me and I want him in my life even if it is not romantically. \n\nOne of his friends was making the long drive across the country to go visit him over the holidays. They wanted me to tag along and go see him. I decided not to. I cannot be what he wants right now. I can't commit to someone 1000+ miles away, or someone that I was so unhappy with in the past, and he wants that commitment. I am unwilling to commit so I see that it is unwise to entertain any idea of us seeing each other right now. He now wants to fly me out to see him. I don't even fully know how to convey to him what trauma he put me through and I do not think he fully understands. He has said to me more than once \"I don't know what else you want me to do to show you I've changed.\"\n\nI need advice for any and all of this. Do I give him another chance? Should I see him? Should I move on with my other potential romantic persuits? How do I get him to understand how hard on me all of this was when he doesnt want to talk to me about it? Would cutting contact be too harsh if he continues to push and not understand? Help me reddit. Idk how to handle this anymore.\n\n‚óã‚óã‚óã\n\nTLDR: toxic ex bf wants me back in his life after some serious reform. I am unsure how to handle the situation while causing the least amount of strife for both of us"

                "body": "My best friend and I are 20F. We have been friends since we were 12. We used to do everything together and have weekly game nights. Early in our friendship I moved 6 hours away to live with my mom. We considered ourselves sisters- her sister was my sister and her mom, my mom. During my senior year I spent several months with them during lockdown. Currently in 2022 i moved an additional 700 miles away to attend college. It is a two hour plane ride from each other. \n\nNow to more background.\n\nShe had been dating a guy for 3 years and were friends a year before that. They got engaged in February 2021, a few days after she turned 19. \nI was not aware that they were a serious as they were and I asked her if we could talk about their engagement and future together. Throughout there relationship I wasn‚Äôt told very much and I didn‚Äôt realize things were as serious as I should have assumed. I was excited for her! She wanted to have a husband and children- those were her goals in life. I was worried her relationship was a touch co dependent and I wanted to talk to her. \n\nA few months later, July, She finds out that she is pregnant. Her fianc√© comes from a very conservative family and because of this they told no one. The only people who were aware of this were her roommates, myself, and another friend of hers. I was told to keep the pregnancy a secret from her family. She was always paranoid that I would tell her family when that was never even an option in my mind.\n\nShe was not interested in talking to me about her relationship. She perceived everything as an attack and was not willing to compromise. I told her I wanted to be there to support her marriage on her wedding day knowing why he was the guy for her. \n\nI was worried about her. She has been previously abused by men and I was worried she was stuck in survival mode. We used to tell everything to each other. Her silence only confirmed my suspicions that something was not right. \n\nHer wedding was in September 2021. Myself and her other friend were joint maids of honor and we were both unhappy to be left out of the loop. We confided in each other because our friend was unreachable. Her pregnancy was a nightmare- we were talking to a stranger and a shell of the girl who was there beforehand. She basically told me to get on board and i did. I was supportive, present, running errands for her. Anything she needed I was. I wanted to be able to say that i stuck it out and that i was there for here.\n\nI asked if i would be included in her family photos and she told me yes only to exclude me when the moment came. Her friend and i never got a dance with her. We have a lot up to be there and she never even said thank you. My long time girlfriend wasn‚Äôt even invited to the wedding. \n\nI had given up a lot to be as present as I had been the year of 2021. I lived 8 hours away and frequently drove to attend wedding events or be there to support her. She only came to see me once, she left the second her fianc√© called and said that he missed her. I warned her not to drive back- the weather would be bad and would be better the next day. She decided to leave anyways and ended up having to pull over and get a hotel room. Her fianc√© drove to the hotel room despite her protests that it wasn‚Äôt safe and they spent the night together.\n\nI admittedly am very hurt and bitter about the year I experienced. \n\nShe is upset with me that i resent her husband. She is upset that i was ever uncomfortable around her husband. She tells me our friendship is co dependent. I ask for a day to hang out with just the two of us every two months and she gets upset with me. We hang out by playing games online together. \n\nI now live a 2 hour plane ride away and i have offered to purchase tickets for her and her daughter but she says no. That her daughter cant be separated from her father for four days because he only gets to see her on nights and weekends.\n\nI offer to come stay with her and she tells me she doesn‚Äôt want that either. That because I ever disliked her husband she wont allow it. I would like to add that I have told her that I am willing to work on that relationship and the only way to do that is by interacting with him. She tells me thats the solution but then tells me she doesn‚Äôt want that to happen. I ask her what she wants me to do and she dodges the question. \n\nIm at a loss as to what to do. I don‚Äôt think she trusts me anymore. I dint know what I did to deserve that. She is defensive and unwilling to communicate without arguing. I try to talk to her or ask her what she is up to and she says she likes the stuff between her other relationships to stay mire personal. Im not asking for info about her other relationships btw. She has hurt me but I value our relationship. I‚Äôm not super willing to cut her off but im kind if thinking thats the next step."

                "body": "\nI ( 22m) feel like my girlfriend (19f) and I have reached a point where our relationship has changed. We have been doing long distance now for over a year. We met online and over the last year and a half have been able to see each other 5 separate times. I live in USA and my girlfriend is living in madrid attending university there. We became ‚Äúofficial‚Äù 6months ago and I just got back from a trip to madrid for the first 2 weeks of November. Since we have always been far apart we have often talked about feeling lonely and wanting attention. My gf had brought up having an open relationship so she can go on dates and meet other people. She pretty much has been toying with the idea since she first moved to madrid in last September. She downloaded tinder and has been using it to talk to people. She didn‚Äôt actually start going on dates until after I left this last trip. She also was just meeting other girls and no guys. 3 days after I left she went out with a girl and got drunk and hooked up with her. We had talked and fantasized about a hook up but this wasn‚Äôt planned it just happened because she got drunk and decided to do that without talking to me about it. This incident didn‚Äôt bother me so much, my gf didn‚Äôt enjoy it and I wasn‚Äôt worried about her getting too involved with the girl. Soon after she started looking for guys and we talked about it and I was okay with her looking for a date. She found a guy the same day lol and they went out the next weekend. She said he was nerdy and not attractive to her and could just be a good friend because they were both science nerds. Anyway she starts talking to this guy everyday. Me and her talk about her hooking up with him, not full sex but a blowjob. We were getting our kink on haha. Well she decides to do it and goes and gets drinks and takes him home and they hook up. Now of course I‚Äôm a little jealous but it was fun and new for me I wasn‚Äôt upset about it. But then she continues to talk to him everyday and she hangouts with him like every other day for the next week. Nothing else sexual but she tells me they kiss and hold hands and little romantic stuff. This is when I became upset. We agreed on trying out hook ups but we also talked about not getting attached. She fights to still hangout with him after I tell her how I feel. She doesn‚Äôt care how I feel compared to wanting company and attention. She invited him over to her apartment one day while I‚Äôm alseep. I wake up and she tells me he‚Äôs been there for an hour and they‚Äôre just eating lunch and hanging out. Oh I want to make it very clear that she PROMISED me she just wanted to study. About an hour later I get a FaceTime from her in bed with him telling me they got horny and she wants to fuck him. I had this big flash of wanted to just break up with her in that moment but I told her that ‚Äú she could do what she wants‚Äù obviously I sound uncomfortable but I just see her face look over at the guy and smile cuz she is so excited to fuck him. She asks if I want to watch and I said yes. I realized after this moment that this whole time I‚Äôve been over-sexualizing my gf in these hook up situations in order to cope with the fact that it makes me uncomfortable. So I start trying to focus on the sexual aspect of it. After kissing and stuff on bed before anything happens she sees my camera was turned off and asks me if everything‚Äôs okay and if I‚Äôm okay with it and I tell her she knows exactly how I feel. Then she starts crying and getting upset and the whole rest of that call was awkward and painful. Anyway it‚Äôs been literally a week since that haha and she went on a date yesterday with a guy. We both decided we aren‚Äôt open and she will only hangout with friends, she said she can meet people off tinder and other apps but I can‚Äôt go meet any girls lol. She hung out with this new guy yesterday for over 8hrs txted me a little during it. But she was out so late and then just texted me ‚Äú I‚Äôm home I‚Äôm exhausted‚Äù and she fell asleep I guess. It‚Äôs been over 8hrs since she sent that message. This is hard because our time zones are different and she was out super late for me so I stayed up very late. She gets so upset and mad at me when I don‚Äôt pay enough attention or make time to call her but as soon as she has something or someone to give her attention she doesn‚Äôt even think twice about me. Her date went from being 5pm-8:30 or 9pm and instead she was out until past 1AM. She swears she loves me and wants to keep trying but there‚Äôs been so many times when she has chosen another guys attention over me just because it was more instant or available in that moment. She‚Äôs actually kissed at least 4 people since we‚Äôve been dating possibly 5 idk what happened last night lol. Okay well that was a lot of venting I better stop now otherwise it will just keep going. I just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs hopeless, is my girlfriend just a cheater. Like should I stop now before I continue to get hurt and feel more and more uncomfortable. Fuck this really sucks, I love her a lot I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs so easier for her to cheat I couldn‚Äôt meet and hook up with people so easy I would feel bad becuase I love her but it just doesn‚Äôt even matter to her. :(. I‚Äôm so fucking sad. I want a hug. I‚Äôm just sitting at work alone feeling like shit"

It was going well between us and it we had beautiful time.\n1 thing we always fought about is when she talks bad about my parents, and the reason? Because they always forgive my brother who fights very often with my family.\n\n\nMy girlfriend always insults my parents, have fun of them, and talks bad about them, telling such a things like \"they are dumb people\" , \"they are low intelligent people, thow they can forgive him haha\". And starts laughing.\n\n\nActually when she haves fun of them and insults them it gets on my nerves. Despite the fact that i may agree with her that my parents are loose with my brother but it is not right to talk bad about them.\n\n\nWe fought more than 50 times about this i swear. \nI talked to her politely face to face like 20 times. We sat and talked and i explained exactly what hurts me and how she hurts me when she laughs about them and i don't like it. I told her that she can tell me her opinion politely and i accept it.\n\n\nI sent her what hurts me through Whatsapp messages like 20 times also, and they were pretty long messages.\nShe would never respect my feelings and never considerate me.\n\n\nI mean i told her \"i always try to take care of you and if something bothers you and you tell me about it i 1 time i stop doing it, why don't you do the same when i told you million times\"? And she shows no reaction and seem careless.\n\n\nUntil last week when she started laughing at them and having fun of them i couldn't hold my self and i told her \"your father is psycho, and stop stating the flaws and complaining about my parents because if i want to state the flaws and complain about your parents i couldn't stop But actually i dont care because all i see is you and me and complaining about them doesn't benefit us.\" \n\n\nAnd ever since she didnt send me anything neither called, while i did and tried to send her but she didn't react to me neither messaged back.\n\n\nIm pretty sure if we ever talk again she wouldn't change and i can't live with someone who disrespects my feelings.\n\n\n 1 week she started uploading instagram stories with that boy that i always felt that she had some feeling toward him.\n\n\nIm a bit misoriented.\n\n\nAm i guilty here ?\n\nAm i dumb if i started talking and sending to her again?"

                "body": "The only reason I even ask is because I don't want to start unnecessary drama in their marriage if it's an old, inactive profile. \n\n\nMy friend got married earlier this year to a woman I know he loves with his whole heart. I think they've been together for about 7 or 8 years total at this point. They seemed happy at the wedding, and I don't really have any reason to expect things are on the rocks for them. I usually see this friend once a week and, while we haven't had any close 1 on 1 time recently, both of us have always been comfortable being open and emotionally vulnerable with one another. He has vented to me about relationship troubles with previous partners in the past, and I think he knows he could come talk to me if his marriage was in a rough patch. This man is one of my oldest friends, I love him like a brother and only want what's best for him. I'm not super close with his wife (I moved away for a few years when they had started dating), but we are friendly and I have always thought she's good for him. She's a little shy though, so I don't really think I have a complete picture of her personality. I know reddit likes to read too much into little pieces of information like this but all I'm trying to say is, while I doubt she's toxic or manipulative there is a possibility that she has that side and I've never seen it. \n\n\nI've been single for a little while now and regularly scroll through tinder in my down time. It seems I've aged out of the biggest tinder dating pool, so I see a lot of the same profiles come up again. Tonight, I saw my friend's wife on there for the first time. Her bio just had her IG handle and while there were no pictures of her with her husband, there were three with her SIL (my friend's sister). \n\n\nMy first thought was that it may just be an old profile. Afaik they had some normal relationship trouble a few years ago, after she had moved with him back to our hometown but before they were engaged. Maybe tinder was throwing old profiles at me to keep me using the app? My roommate told me that tinder won't show profiles if the user has been inactive for more than 7 days, but I don't know if that's true. I also wondered if maybe she was using it to make new friends! She's not from this city and is shy, as mentioned above, so she could just be trying to meet other women our age. This isn't uncommon here, but usually those profiles will clarify such intentions in a bio. \n\n\nI would want to protect my friend if his partner is cheating on him, so I think I should just tell him what I saw. He may know she has a tinder, he may be on board for any number of reasons. It's possible he's into some stuff I didn't know about, and I wouldn't really judge him for it if that was the case. My only concern is if it is just an old, inactive profile and my bringing it up causes conflict in their relatively new marriage when she wasn't cheating, trying to cheat, or even considering it. I'm trying to be rational and give her the benefit of the doubt, thinking of possible explanations before bringing it up with him. In the end, I think I'll ask to catch up over a beer with him this weekend and just be straight up, tell him I saw his wife's tinder and didn't know if I should be concerned. What do y'all think?\n\n\n\n\nBtw, I don't think age is super relevant to this situation, but we are all mid/late twenties. He and I are the same age, she's a year younger. I think this detail is important only because I could see her cheating as a more likely possibility if she was 3-4 years younger; like if it was a case of her being in a serious relationship her whole adult life and feeling like she had missed out on sowing her wild oats."

I stayed quiet. \n\nAfter that, I texted my best friend who we will call E, male. He told me that if I really wanted to, I was capable of ‚Äústealing‚Äù C from J. Mind you, he‚Äôs not the first one to tell me that, my other friend said that too, and honestly, I feel like if I tried hard enough, I could probably get with her. \n\nSo the question is, how do I subtly let her know that I would date her, and should I try to get with her? Also I talk to J a little bit, but not that much."

I called him thursday night and he decided to cancel our plans so he could see his friend play God of War. I was upset because he had already seen his friend three days before that and he had not seen me for two weeks. If we didn‚Äôt see each other that weekend then it would be three weeks total of not seeing each other. \n\nI got upset because it felt like he wasn‚Äôt prioritizing me and I felt like he didn‚Äôt care enough. His friend who he keeps hanging out with also lives two minutes down his street and my boyfriend can visit that friend anytime meanwhile he barely sees me. \n\nWe got into an argument over that and he said ‚ÄúWell I have to get up in the morning for work so I‚Äôm going to sleep, I love you‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt say it back. I said ‚Äúmhm‚Äù and then hung up. That call was Thursday night and we didn‚Äôt talk on Friday or Saturday. He ended up blocking my number and then unblocking it to call me on Sunday to break up. He told me I needed to stop being petty. \n\nI just feel so upset because I don‚Äôt think that was a good reason to just break up. Like if you love someone you don‚Äôt just break up with them that easily? I just don‚Äôt know what to do in this situation. I just want him to regret it but I don‚Äôt know. I still love him a lot and it hurts. What could I have done better in this situation? I feel like I could have handled things better as well but I let my emotions get to me.\n\n\nTdrl; boyfriend broke up with me over an argument, reasonable? What could I have done better to prevent it from happening?"

For a full week we were chatting as we normally were and then gradually I wasn‚Äôt getting much effort, he was barely messaging and when he was it was half arsed.

We know virtually everything about each other and tend to not open up much to other people. He has diagnosed anxiety and (from what he and I believe to be undiagnosed OCD) for the most part you wouldn‚Äôt really notice it unless you lived with him.  He‚Äôs honestly the perfect partner, he‚Äôs shown me love in the best of ways and always goes out of his way and above and beyond for me. \n\nWe honestly don‚Äôt really have any issues except for this one, it sounds awful to say but sometimes I feel like he‚Äôs way too sensitive? I‚Äôm not quite sure how to put it nicely, he always puts himself down for it and he is currently in therapy, but he has a tough time opening up in his sessions so it‚Äôs hard to say what progress is there. I‚Äôm not saying this because I have any issue with him showing emotions in front of me, in fact I feel so so lucky that I‚Äôm about the only person he can open to without the need for alcohol first. What I have an issue with however, is the fact his ‚Äòsensitivity‚Äô made me virtually unable to share any of my emotions in front of him.\n\nI‚Äôve recently have been having familial issues and I have brought it up to him on different occasions while I‚Äôm upset or even slightly crying.  Before I can even get a few words out, he‚Äôs already sniffling, and if I continue he‚Äôll burst out into a crying fit, and I end up having to console him because he really goes all in. I‚Äôll ask him why he‚Äôs crying so profusely and he‚Äôll say it‚Äôs because he feels like he can‚Äôt help me, and that he‚Äôs a bad boyfriend because he can‚Äôt fix all of my problems. I understand the frustration of not being able to help your partner with everything, but when he rants to me I don‚Äôt bawl my eyes out because he had an exhausting day at work or a fight with his friend. \n\n It just ends up with me feeling a little frustrated and a little hurt, like I have to put my feelings on hold or I can‚Äôt share the full extent of my emotions with him because *half* of it ends up upsetting him to no end. I really am happy he‚Äôs so empathetic and it‚Äôs one of the things that attracted me to him but this is so very exhausting. To his credit he does recognize this as an issue, and he‚Äôll say when it happens that he‚Äôs sorry and that he‚Äôs ‚Äúmaking it all about himself‚Äù and that he should be consoling me. Which, I mean yeah that‚Äôs all true imo, partners should be there for the other person in that moment, and be a shoulder to cry on. But I just end up telling him that it‚Äôs okay, and I just try to calm him down before he starts hyperventilating, and then sometimes he even just starts talking about what‚Äôs troubling him and I have to sit and console him through that and repress my inner problems for the next few weeks. I‚Äôve been almost lying to him and pressing my feelings down about most things that upset me because I don‚Äôt want to upset him. I know that I could tell these things to a therapist, and I might see one in the future for more serious things but it would just be nice to be able to tell my partner the simple upsetting things without him completely breaking down about it. It‚Äôs a little weird to explain, I just really want to know how to help him, because it really hurts me because I always have shoved my emotions down as a kid to please other people and I really don‚Äôt want to do that with someone who‚Äôs supposed to be my life partner.\n\nThanks to whoever read all that, I hope it made sense."

                "body": "TL;DR - Wife and I have a dysfunctional sex life which led to a lot of hurt feelings on both sides. I bottled that up and stuck it deep inside me and forgot about it. It‚Äôs back now and I don‚Äôt know how to address it with her in a healthy and effective way.\n\nMy wife and I have been together for about a decade, married for about half of that time. I remember that I fell for her hard when we started dating and was ready to propose to her within a year of us becoming official. We clearly took longer, for which I am now grateful, but the point is that I thought the world of this woman.\n\nAnd I still do. For the most part our marriage is great. We enjoy many of the same things. We laugh, we‚Äôre supportive, we regularly do both adventurous and romantic things together. I would say that for 80% of our relationship, we‚Äôre in a really great place. My wife is an incredible woman and I am very grateful for who she is and everything she has done to enrich my life.\n\nBut here‚Äôs the catch, I just (as in an hour ago while filing bills) became aware that there is also a part of me that now deeply resents her. The same woman who has brought so much healing and joy into my life, has also carved out some deep cuts too. So, without further ado, let‚Äôs talk about sex.\n\nWe were both deeply religious growing up and met in a church environment. Because of the tension between what we wanted and what we felt we should do, we both had minor experiences fooling around with exes but neither of us had any experience with penetrative sex prior to getting married. I think we both expected it to come easy and naturally when we tied the knot. It very much didn‚Äôt.\n\nWe‚Äôve been married for years now and have never once had ‚ÄúPiV‚Äù sex. I know that‚Äôs not the holy grail and we have both pleasured each other to plenty of orgasms in other ways. I add that only to provide some context for what follows.\n\nAs sexual partners, we were very mismatched. Her birth control had tanked her libido (only learned that within the last year when she went off), so she needed a lot of consistent stimuli in an emotionally connected atmosphere over time to get aroused. I grew up in an emotionally restricted family and have ADHD (diagnosed in pre-pandemic in 2019); balance, consistency, and emotional connection are not my strong points. She tried to push through her lack of desire when I initiated, but any mis-step (miscommunication, wrong pressure, shifted wrong, etc.) would kill the evening. Each time felt like a fresh rejection and hurt began to build up. \n\nI was not allowed to feel as a kid - and carried that into adulthood - so I wasn‚Äôt aware enough  of that hurt to communicate about it. What‚Äôs more, I have always been hyper critical of myself. My dad told me a story once that he came home work one day when I was about three, saw me sitting alone in my room calling myself ‚Äústupid‚Äù. He left me alone. That was my childhood - and most of my life - in a nutshell. In the darkness of my self-ignorance, vicious criticism flourished like moss on a ruin. I wish I had known how to act then. I didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs on me. \n\nEventually my hurt and self-anger grew too much to mask, and I began to get frustrated with her. I never insulted her, disrespected her, or even yelled at her. I did worse - I emotionally iced her out to protect myself from that hurt. The emotional connection she needed to feel safe shattered.\n\nThe cycle got worse from there. She began to blame herself every time we ‚Äòfailed‚Äô at sex. Now we were both doing it. Sex became not just a stressor but an outright conflict. Until we started avoiding it altogether.\n\nThere are a lot of other factors at play, family crises, job issues, medication side-effects. But the core of the problem is here: I just ran smack into the realization that all that hurt and pain is still nestled safe within me, thriving in a walled off garden that I locked the door to, threw away the key, and forgot about. We‚Äôve been really trying to work on our sexual relationship. We want to have biological children, PiV sex is a necessary for that. But I‚Äôve been struggling to show up completely and just discovered that this is why. \n\nI know I need to talk to her. I want to talk to my therapist first (next session is in a week and a half). The problem is that I don‚Äôt want to walk into a conversation with her and just open that garden door up and let all that poison out. I can feel it now and it scares me. I know much of that anger is a protective mechanism against the hurt of feeling rejected by her, of feeling like she also didn‚Äôt think I was good enough. And I‚Äôve done enough therapy to realize too that a lot of that isn‚Äôt even there because of her, just the remnants of a human being that she inherited from my parents. But I don‚Äôt know how to let her in without lashing out (to be clear, not in a violent or abusive way, but my anger or iciness towards her hurts her). I don‚Äôt want to hurt her. And I know that not addressing it will lead to further problems and the hurt that I want to avoid. I just don‚Äôt know how to.\n\nI love my wife. She wants to make things work with me, she‚Äôs willing to work on it. Most of me wants to make things work with her, and I‚Äôm willing to work on it. I‚Äôve been in therapy and have gotten much more emotionally connected and aware. Our communication has improved, my ADHD is treated now (which has helped but it‚Äôs a temporary support not a permanent cure), and I‚Äôve helped her to feel emotionally safe with me again. I‚Äôm just bone deep afraid of getting pushed back into that dark place and I don‚Äôt know what to do about that. \n\nI guess what I‚Äôm hoping for is guidance from someone who has been here before. I‚Äôm not coming into this as a saint. I know my damage is responsible for much (if not most) of this. I know she wasn‚Äôt perfect either. I‚Äôm not interested in divorce, non-monogamy (cheating or open relationships), or anything separate from making us whole. I just want some help on getting this poison out of me so we can keep moving towards the marriage we‚Äôd like to have together.\n\nThanks."

                "body": "Title is pretty self explanatory but for further context:\n\nI (27NB) dated someone (27NB) for about three months earlier this year. Things seemed to be going really well, they said and did things that led me to believe the feelings I had for them were mutual, and then they seemed to abruptly lose interest. We went from texting very consistently throughout the day and making regular plans to see each other, to them rarely responding to my texts more than once and never mentioning hanging out again.\n\nThis went on for a couple of weeks, they acknowledged their behavior was weird but offered no explanation or did anything to change it. Eventually I broke things off because I didn't think they would do so otherwise, rather that they would just never speak to me again and the breakup would be implied, and ending things outright seemed better than that. I hoped they would offer some further explanation but they didn't. They never really spoke to me again again except to match with me on Tinder once about six months ago but then tell me they only wanted to be friends, followed by more radio silence until I remade my social media accounts and they never followed me again.\n\nI know that seems pretty cut and dry- they aren't interested and that's fine, I'm in a happy relationship now and I know their behavior says more about them than me- but I genuinely cannot stop thinking about what went wrong. If I did something wrong, or if they just realized they didn't like me as much as they thought they did...it bothers me to the point of feeling very upset or losing sleep. I would like to ask them in a straightforward way for a genuine explanation, but I know I'll probably come off as pathetic or crazy. I just want to stop thinking about it so I can focus on the person who actually likes me and be present with them.\n\nTL;DR: Someone ghosted me after three months of dating, matched me on Tinder to \"be friends\" only to immediately ghost again, the whole thing has really messed with me and I would like to figure out what I did wrong or what their deal is but I don't want to seem pitiful and weird."

At that time I was in a 2 year long relationship with my boyfriend (23M) but we had a lot of problems and were thinking of breaking up. Tbh when I went on that trip I was taking times to think if it will be better if we went on our separate ways. Long story short, me, my cousin and let‚Äôs call him David, had a great time, but I couldn‚Äôt help but notice, David was kind of flirting with me. I thought nothing of it, cause I knew him since I was a kid (literally)and he always was that ,,hot irresistible sexy player‚Äù type. I caught myself being kinda interested in him, but I knew it was wrong, since I have a boyfriend and he was my cousin bff. When we came back home from our trip me and my bf broke up, because of a lot of things, but firstly, I know it‚Äôs not right to think about someone else, while in a relationship. I ended up texting David and after chatting for a few days he asked me out. We had a beautiful walk in the mountain and watched the sunset together. We did end up having sex and when I tell you - it was amazing. I mean, he‚Äôs experienced lol. Me and David continued seeing each other in secret for a couple of months, but every time I saw him I felt something more and more‚Ä¶ He was always so caring, gentle, thoughtful. He always asked about my day, my week and we really talked about it. I shared him my biggest secrets and he was so supportive. He was the only person I could talk to about certain things. He was always nice, never got in a single fight with me, we just talked our conflicts out, it felt like magic. Time passed by, but me and David weren‚Äôt official and I don‚Äôt think we were ever gonna be. It was a secret that couldn‚Äôt be exposed mainly because of the conflicts it was gonna cause in my family. After some time me and my first bf got back together because I had attachment issues (we lived together our whole relationship) and I thought I couldn‚Äôt be alone. But before I got back in a relationship, me and David exchanged b-day gifts. Each one of us wrote the other a letter to read on the birthday. When I read mine i bursted into tears, cause it was the most genuine and wholesome thing someone has ever wrote for me. When David‚Äôs bday came he texted me how thankful he is and how amazing I am and I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling the whole day.\nMe and my bf still don‚Äôt get along, we live together, but we fight over everything, he tells me I‚Äôm useless, that I should listen to him and do everything he says and that sometimes I deserve to be beaten up. Please believe me I tried everything to fix that relationship and now I‚Äôm desperate.\nTurns out my cousin knew about me and David the whole time, cause David didn‚Äôt want to lie to his best friend. My cousin told me that he was mad at first, but then he saw that we were enjoying ourselves and accepted it. My cousin says he thinks me and David are in love, he says he hasn‚Äôt seen him to things like that and talk like that for any other woman and they know themselves since kindergarten. My cousin has forbidden the contact between us as long as I‚Äôm in a relationship. Everyday I think about texting David, everything reminds me of him, I check his socials every day, I can‚Äôt get him out of my mind. Idk what I should do. Should I leave my relationship? Should I try harder? Should I contact David? I‚Äôm confused."

She struggled a lot with post natal depression after her third baby, so I spent a lot of time at their place because I lived close and I was working from home at the time so my days were pretty open. As a teacher, he would be gone all day so I didn‚Äôt spend much time with him as I would leave when he got home. Fast forward about six months and my friend was hospitalized for a few days so she asked if I would help her bf out at home with the kids. Me and his mom did a lot of it between us as well as the bf so I was spending a lot of time at their place. \n\nI guess you can guess where this is going. One night after I‚Äôd helped him get the kids fed and to bed, he offered to order a takeaway and we sat and ate it over a few beers. Quite quickly he started saying he couldn‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm single and that he wishes his gf was more like me etc. I was super uncomfortable so I stood up to wash up the dishes and he also stood up, turned my body around and started to kiss me. I instantly moved away, asked him what the f he was doing, and left. That night,  sent me a string of messages calling me frigid and a prick tease etc. \n\nI continued to help his mom with the kids while he was working until my friend returned home about a week later. She was pretty unwell so I didn‚Äôt want to add to her stress, so I just avoided any contact with him and acted as though nothing had happened in front of her. He was being a total dick to me though. Mocking me and acting super cocky to the point that my friend started to notice and told me to just ignore him. \n\nAs my friend began to get better, a mutual friend of ours advised me to tell her. She (the mutual friend) told me that her coworker had said he‚Äôd also hit on her in a bar and been aggressive when she turned him down. Hearing this, I knew I had to tell her so one afternoon when he was at work and the kids were with her MIL, I told her what what happened. She was pretty quiet at first and looked embarrassed but not shocked. Then as we talked she said that I must have misunderstood his intentions and said it‚Äôs best if I don‚Äôt come to the house for a while. \n\nThat was about three weeks ago and since then she‚Äôs been cold in texts and I haven‚Äôt heard from her. He messaged calling me all kinds of things including a home-wrecker and a terrible friend until I blocked him. \n\nI‚Äôm totally lost about what to do. I‚Äôm angry with my friend for taking his side but I‚Äôve also seen how aggressive and controlling he can be so I‚Äôm concerned that she is being emotionally manipulated and abused.  Plus they have three children and she has no family and I know she worries that he would get the lion‚Äôs share of custody if they ever separated. I think if she had proof of his cheating it would help her to admit it to herself as well as help her in any future custody battles. I contacted a few women on Instagram to ask them to contact him to see if he‚Äôd respond but none of them were willing to do it. But beyond that I don‚Äôt have any ideas. \n\n How can I get my friend to see that I‚Äôm not the enemy?"

There was absolutely nothing wrong in our relationship to warrant this kind of shutting me out.\n\nHe broke up with me because he was depressed and wanted time to work on himself. Yet, since then he's been drinking all day, staying up til 5 am gaming, and doing drugs (acid and shrooms, he's always used weed but I don't care about weed)\n\nHe has no problem talking to my friend and telling her he still loves me and he thinks he was a terrible boyfriend. My friend keeps assuring him that I have NEVER thought he was a terrible boyfriend, in fact, I thought the opposite. Whenever she suggests just simply TALKING TO ME he just repeats the same shit over and over again, I'm scared, I still love her, I'm nervous, I was such a bad boyfriend, I'm not ready, etc, etc.\n\nShe has told him that I'm really anxious and I am not mad at him I just want to talk and understand.\n\nI feel like I'm about to lose my mind. I cannot sleep. I have barely eaten anything since. I can't go an hour without having such a debilitating panic attack that I find myself wanting to rip my own hair out.\n\nWe spent every day together, it's so hard to not be talking to him. I don't understand how it's so easy for him to shut me out when he was the one who initiated dating me, even after I said I didn't want to date. I told him I didn't want to move fast, and he kept moving fast. Because of moving fast, we developed a very codependent relationship. He kept talking about wanting to get married, even the day before he broke up with me. I always told him to slow down with marriage but eventually thought that it was just me self-sabotaging and if I truly love him, and he truly loves me and treats me right, why wouldn't I marry him in a year or two?\n\nI just don't get it. Does anyone have any advice for what my friend can say to get him to stop acting like this? She's been super nice to him because they're friends as well.. but I'm wondering if maybe a different tactic should be used.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: bf wont talk to me because he says he's scared. when told nothing is wrong and i'm not mad, he still won't listen."

We were still having sex but physical intimacy in between times was completely missing. A couple of times recently I noticed he had left the house in the morning for work whilst I was in the kitchen without even saying good morning! He didn‚Äôt even notice he had done it when I pointed it out to him! I was wondering about having a one night stand to see how I felt about him (you guys convinced me that was wrong- thanks!) I talked to my husband about how I was feeling and we decided to try to improve things. Unfortunately things haven‚Äôt improved. My husbands idea of an improvement was to put his arm around me in bed, and occasionally whilst making dinner but honestly I felt little affection from him at other times. No little texts or calls or anything. I‚Äôve tried to talk to him but he either can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt talk about his feelings, he says he loves me and that‚Äôs all he can say. I‚Äôve told him I NEED to talk things through to get through this but he seems incapable. Or unwilling. \nThings came to a head this week when I tried AGAIN to get him to talk to me, I know he finds it difficult so I chose just when we had gone to bed this time so it was dark and he didn‚Äôt have to look me in the eye even. and just got silence, I told him we needed to get things out there even if he wrote it down but it needed sorting and left it there. The next day I left early and the next night he barely spoke to me all night at bedtime he tried to put his arm around me and I just moved it away and said no we need to talk this out. The next morning I was in the bathroom getting ready for work, when I came out he‚Äôd already left- without saying good morning or goodbye - he was leaving on a work trip which meant I wouldn‚Äôt see him for three days. He didn‚Äôt contact me in all the time he was away, whilst away our daughter received a hospital appointment for a few weeks away which I forwarded to him, he didn‚Äôt comment. He got home last night and barely spoke. I slept in the spare room last night. What now?"

Two months later (may) we find out we are having a baby he was so excited and couldn‚Äôt believe he actually found the woman of his dreams and was going to become a father. I was in the middle of figuring out some mental health thing involving childhood trauma and couldn‚Äôt believe it, happy but still couldn‚Äôt believe it was real and the scariest part was telling my family. Early in the relationship I cheated with a friend drunkenly I made one of the worst mistakes of my life. We were struggling with communication or I was. I tried being in the relationship that kinda just happened so fast while working on my mental health just so I could even show up for myself and then I was pregnant stressed and over emotional. He didn‚Äôt leave but I had to work to get his trust back and that‚Äôs just what I did after (July) I got my shot together. We started taking parenting classes a lot about communicating and how we want to raise our baby. Things got a lot better he still claimed that he wasn‚Äôt happy at times but we were really happy making sure to do things we like to do together learning more about each other and just trying to have fun before we have this little boy. Six months later (Now) our coworker tells me he‚Äôs been cheating and sends me his dick pick and messages between the two of them. A lot of them where him desperately telling her she‚Äôs cute and her just saying thanks or ok or even I got to go. Some talking about my baby and I and then cut off pictures. She says that nothing happened between them besides him just talking a big game of what he wanted to happen between them. She told me twice that he said I was cheating on him like that was supposed to make it okay when she obviously knew we were still together and we had a baby on the way. I confronted him and he lied, I broke down in tears later and said I just want him to be honest and he spilled everything. He also let me go through the Snapchat he was hiding from me and I found out she was talking mad shit about me and the cut of picture of the convo was her saying she was jealous of my pregnancy bc it should have been her. She also went to our boss after being blocked and said he was messaging her making her uncomfortable therefore he was fired. \nI want to make the right decision for this baby and I and I know I need to follow my heart but it‚Äôs also hard when most of your family saw you at your lowest and wants you to leave him. I am not living with him anymore but we are back to the dating stage sleep overs on the night before doctors appointments and hanging out every once and a while for short amounts of time. He already has job opportunities lined up and had even talked about going to counseling for himself then together to continue the healing.\nAm I stupid to still be seeing him?\nAm I stupid to still love the living shit out of this man when he fucked up and my life seems to be crumbling down?"

Reason i say on and off is because his dad has gotten inbetween us and forced my bf away from me multiple times. I was brought up with 2 parents siblings watching my dad and my mum working their butts off to provide for us. When i met my bf i was 14 in school and i feel for him, his personality, his smile nothing could compare to him.\n\nThe only problem he had was a hygiene problem, hed get bullied badly for it by i saw passed all of it for who he was. When i went over to his house i started to realise why, his dad did not bath, shower, wash at all, and hes one of those who always thinks hes right and his excuse is ‚Äúit washes the oils off your body‚Äù, baring in mind this guy has gone weeks, months without washing. So my bf being brought up by him since he was 7 cos his mum walked out on them has obviously took those habits from his father. I was/am hopeless in love with my bf, i started to teach him how to wash, how often he should be washing, i even watched barber tutorials so i could cut his hair for him.\n\nHis dad has bipolar and hes also a massive narcissist and he used to beat my bfs mum as to why she left dont blame her. He shouted at me and my bf for hugging infront of him because it ‚Äúoffended him‚Äù. He also cusses women in general, bit of a mysoginist too. So you could imagine the way poor 14-17 yr old me was treated, even mocked calling me a s- for having instagram when i was 16. At 17 me and my bf split because me and his dad fought pretty badly because i was angry at how much he neglected my bf and he only gave a damn about his online gfs. And how ive had to teach him how to wash himself, his clothes, cut his hair and try and focus on his grades and his school work because his dad was depressing him with his moaning at my bf about how he cant afford to provide for him, and telling him to f off and move out with me asap. At 16 years old. Because the lazy c word of his dad wont get a job because he thinks hes hacking life by scrimping and scrapping. Barely providing for his kids, 2 boys, cos my bf has a brother whos younger, who his dad has always favoured because he acts more like his dad and we all know he loves himself. \n\nThey had social services out and told him my bf was underweight and how his brother was noticably bigger. All because his dad was jealous of my bf for having me in his life. You can start to understand why i hate his dad. And at times his mum for leaving. So skip to present day we got back together somehow and i played nice with his dad, for my bfs sake. Im 21 my bf is 22 im working a full time job whereas my bf is not working. Again a week before Christmas his dad has gave my bf the same ultimatum ‚Äúleave her or your out of the house‚Äù. The funniest part about it is again this was over who gave more of a shit about my bfs wellbeing. As his dad had a go again at me for me trying to get my bf a job. And he wants my bf to be like him scrounging off the system and barely surviving. My bf is fully capable of work, he has worked before but his dad dragged him backwards yet again.\n\nMe and my bf are secretly texting behind his dads back so he doesnt kick him out. My bf has a job interview tuesday and we are going to work on him getting out of that house. Away from him. Ive never hated a human being more than his dad. I hope he rots, currently plotting my revenge for when me n bf move in together."

I opened the phone to find that my fianc√© has been texting this random woman for around 6 months. I looked through all of the messages, and I felt terrible about it. They were obviously in a relationship, she has sent explicit images, he had too, and the worst part about it all was that in the most recent conversation, she sent a picture of a positive pregnancy test, which was shocking to me, her, and my fianc√© it seems.

I also probably need to tell him that I'm expecting my 3rd, which was supposed to be a wedding surprise until my fianc√© thought it was a good idea to knock up another woman (other woman had confirmed that it was his in a separate text). \n\nI can't believe after all of these years, all of the hardships we've spent together, that you would cheat on me. We were trying for a baby for two years, and when we finally get pregnant (which to be fair you didn't know about) this is what I am treated by? All I know as of right now is that I want to be free from this man who betrayed me after that long. Life's hard isn't it. Hopefully an update soon.\n\nTLDR: Me and fianc√© have been together for nearly 6 years, he cheated on me and got another woman pregnant. Please give me advice!"

For starts, my current girlfriend is extremely controlling, obsessive, and jealous. For example, she doesn't like me wearing gray sweatpants (never to the point of causing a scene, but making a big deal and making me feel like shit), she has to be on the phone or texting me whenever I am not in school or work, even with friends, and she gets extremely jealous at the thought of other girls and guys thinking about me the way she does. She also constantly wants to fight, she never wants me to go to parties (i'm in my first year of college and I wanted to join a frat but that was an obvious no), and absolutely NO female friends (even from classes). she even prevents me from hanging out with my best friends since middle school. It has always been like this, but it has been starting to snowball and I am now realizing how detrimental it is. She makes me feel like I don't want a relationship with her anymore; she constantly presses the idea of marriage and gets mad when I cannot reciprocate those feelings because of the circumstances. Overall, i'm pretty bent, but it's been over a year and its hard to throw it in the trash.\n\nNow..... for my ex. I never stopped caring about this ex (I met her about 6 months before her and casually dated for 3 months.) it was a genuine first love but we never got around to fully working. When we were together, we just understood each other; we loved the same things, had the same goals, the picture perfect romance. We were with each other all the time, never begged to spend time, but we just naturally wanted to hang out unlike my current girlfriend. Our friends were friends; everything was good. For a long time after we broke up, I hoped she would come back or text about life; just wanting to talk. that never happened, I tried texting her one day and found out I was blocked. We went no contact for a long time, and only heard about her life from mutual friends. She had many flings with many guys so I thought she'd be okay, but it turned out she wasn't. In the midst of the turmoil with my current girlfriend, I found out that she had been getting in trouble with certain powdered substances, and it excited her bpd (it runs in her family). We recently reconnected and she revealed all of this to me. This all happened the summer before college, and her friends convinced her to break up with me for the \"college experience\", which ended our relationship. That was revealed while talking as well. The few friends that did stick around realized that I was the best thing for her. As we started to reconnect our conversations got deeper, she revealed that she loved me and missed me, but she was under the influence. That has really stuck with me and I obviously love her too. (it was mutual but we never talked about it).\n\nThis whole situation got me thinking if I am in the right relationship because I never experienced the negatives with my ex like I do now with my current gf. I don't want to ditch a year relationship , but I also want to be happy for my sake. Should I stay with my current gf, reconnected with an ex, or just be single.\n\nTL;DR: my current girlfriend is toxic and my ex was very compatible for me. My ex and I recently connected and it's sparking new questions."

So we took a 5 hours road trip to Chicago, I drove 5 hours there and 5 hours back. I paid for my own gas in my own car. She never offered to pay. Whenever we had to pay for parking, I paid for it as well and parkings in Chicago are expensive. She kept telling me to go to a hostel and I refused. I paid for our 5 star hotel at the heart of the city without complaints because I was excited to show her around. She was super excited about the 5-star hotel and thanked me for booking it. She loved the hotel. I also paid for a couple of the expensive dinners we had. I didn‚Äôt mind covering the tab occasionally, but now we‚Äôre on our LA trip and she expected me to pay for everything. \n\nWhen we were looking at places to stay in LA, she insisted on booking a cheap Airbnb she found which costed $66/day. She told me to go ahead and book the Airbnb and she will pay me back because we‚Äôre going 50-50. She never did. She also wanted to fly Spirit which I‚Äôve never been on, but I complied because she really wanted to save money. I sat on a 5 hours flight, super uncomfortable. She also complained that it was super uncomfortable as well. When we got to the Airbnb after our flight, it was around 10:30 pm. We were both super tired. She complained about how terrible the dirt cheap Airbnb she found was and wanted to get out of there asap. We sat there and I had to contact customer service for 2 hours to cancel our reservation. In the middle of the night, we had to move all of our luggages and find a hotel to stay which she didn‚Äôt want to pay and I had to. When we got to our room at the hotel, she immediately called the reception desk and demanded the receptionist to move us to another room cause it was ‚Äútoo cold‚Äù. It was around 70 degrees in there. We stayed at the hotel for one night and she found a more expensive Airbnb which costed me nearly a thousand dollar to pay. We got to the Airbnb and she complained about how the water isn‚Äôt hot enough and how the water there makes her skin dry. She puts the heater to 86¬∞F in our room which is SUPER hot. Whenever we go somewhere and there‚Äôs parking, she expects me to pay for it even though she‚Äôs driving. The only contribution she has made for our trip is renting a car which costed her $377. When we go out for meals, she just looks at me and I feel pressured to pay for it. I wanted to get Starbucks, she insisted on McDonald‚Äôs sprite. So she went and got her lil sprite and when it was time to pay, she looked at me and it was $2 so I, again, felt pressure to pay. She didn‚Äôt even thank me, she just said ‚Äúuh huh‚Äù. When I dont pay for things for her, she doesn‚Äôt even want to spend $10 on the Santa Monica Ferris wheel. She‚Äôs so cheap with everything, but always want the nicest quality in life. I‚Äôm so tired of paying for her. I don‚Äôt mind paying for friends occasionally. I‚Äôd like to think that I am a very generous friend, but I am not her mother to be dropping insane amounts of money on her. It‚Äôs not that she‚Äôs poor/broke either, she has money.

Because at this point, I get sad when she ignores me and doesn‚Äôt communicate what‚Äôs wrong until I find out she‚Äôs mourning the death of her deceased bf on Instagram (I deleted Instagram but I check when she‚Äôs lagging hours on me without context to make sure she is okay). And on tiktok. \n\n\nLastly, I am tired of trying so hard for her, I just don‚Äôt know if she really does love me, or is ready for a relationship, or should I leave her heal, I don‚Äôt want to lose her, I would hate to lose her."

I approached him and we really hit it off. We had a lot in common, and learned that we shared similar cultural backgrounds. He was even surprised to see how much I could read him and accurately guess his interests/hobbies, work, etc. Overall it was a great convo and we exchanged socials. \n\nReminiscing over our interaction I realized that he was an attractive guy and our convo was slightly flirtatious, but i‚Äôd prefer to just be friends first and see where things go. Right now i‚Äôm prioritizing making new friends, and build on each connection. After figuring out my intentions and sticking to them I reached out the next day and asked him if he‚Äôd be open to getting food at a place he recommended in our initial conversation. I sent him my number, he texted asking when I was free, and we nailed down a time and date. Unfortunately, a few hours later he messaged me saying ‚ÄúHey, sorry I‚Äôm not looking to date right now.‚Äù And then blocked my number.\n\nI was honestly shocked and confused, but decided to sleep on it just to figure out where things went wrong. The next day I reached out over social media letting him know how confused I was and blindsided I felt about his message, as well as explaining my intentions and apologizing for any miscommunication. He read the message hours ago and i‚Äôm still left with so many questions. Where did things go wrong?"

We have amazing chemistry and nearly every aspect of the relationship is perfect. We have even talked (very informally, and obviously way down the line) about marriage and kids. \n\nThe only issue is sex. My boyfriend is terrified of penetrative sex. We do nearly everything else in the bedroom and overall i am pretty satisfied but i think having sex would take it a step further and it‚Äôs something i want to do with him. We‚Äôve talked about it once before and he said that when he did it with his last girlfriend he had some pain so I guess that is the cause of his anxiety. We tried having penetrative sex once and as soon as we tried to start he immediately got ‚Äúout of the mood‚Äù if you know what I mean. \n\nI‚Äôll start by saying I never want to do anything he isn‚Äôt comfortable with and I never want to pressure him into anything. But at this point I‚Äôm starting to get frustrated. I truly mean it when I say that I would be perfectly okay with it if we never have penetrative sex, and i‚Äôve told him this. But whenever we do things in the bedroom he always hints or outright says that we‚Äôre going to have sex and we never do, which is the biggest part of my issue. Also like i‚Äôve mentioned he‚Äôs talked about having kids down the line.\nI know deep down that it‚Äôs probably irrational, but a part of me is beginning to think that he‚Äôs scared of or doesn‚Äôt want to have sex with me.\n\nSo, I guess my question is how can I support him in our sex life and make him feel comfortable while also making sure we are both totally satisfied in the bedroom?

She has many problems on everyday basis and I cannot seem to help with all of them. But I try to help her with the best advice possible for her to deal with it. But in the end it‚Äôs her decision to do it or not. She has financial problems to deal with since the tuition fees are too much. She cannot quit the since she is already 3rd year now and it will be a waste of money. However, She is now dealing with patients in the hospital and she forgot to copy the vitals when she wrote in hospital of patients. She has no friends to help her with, She‚Äôs introvert so people don‚Äôt really get to know her. Other than that, She expects me to help her with everything on everyday basis like she does her brothers tasks when those idiots just play games. However, I have my own studies and job, other than that I‚Äôm hustling for my own business so I am busy as well. She helps with her house chores to help her mom. She has so much to do, and is majorly stressed and her parents are ignorant about the situation even she tells them about it all they just don‚Äôt care, she would cry often times, I asked her that I will get her the professional help with the online psychologists but she‚Äôs not ready for that as well. Then she has her problems with her laptop, I cannot buy her new one since her parents are strict so she‚Äôs hiding. So the situation is as worst it can get, Her laptop have its ram full and you know it all we need to upgrade it after sometime when our usage is high, Her parents doesn‚Äôt wants to spend money on it so fuck it as well.

Also, Her confidence is low so I also told her to tell her teacher that it‚Äôs the first day of dealing with patients and it‚Äôs fine everyone makes mistakes but she doesn‚Äôt wants her marks to be deducted and also her teacher might say something rude so she‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt tell her as well. Now she doesn‚Äôt have any friends. Her friends school friends are stupid af they just stopped talking to her because she forgot to wish them damn happy birthday. I don‚Äôt know to help her and I tell her to just chill out because the problems will never end it‚Äôs life and it will come out daily. She cannot escape it. Is there anything you can suggest to help me understand my girlfriend and how to help her. ü´§ I will delete this post after 2 days so she doesn‚Äôt find out I‚Äôm asking here or she would be pissed."

                "body": "Hi everyone, \n\nA month ago I went through the most horrific breakup ever. I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôd call it a breakup but rather a straight up abandonment. And I can‚Äôt help but overthink the situation, but as each day passes I am slowly realizing I was potentially manipulated. \n\nContext:\nWhen we first started talking things were great, a little too great (suspected love bombing). He was so verbally and physically affectionate, excessively now that I look back. Immediately saying things like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine my life without you‚Äù, mentioning marriage and making plans for the future. \n\nTwo weeks in he asked me to meet his parents, I set my boundary that this was too soon. The weekend they came to visit he texted me saying ‚Äúmy dad really wants to meet you‚Äù and guilt tripping me. Of course, I cracked. Then, he proceeded to say I love you around the same time. I knew it was way too soon, but I said it back because I didn‚Äôt want to hurt him. \n\nThe first time we had drunk s*x (I was sober) I set the boundary I didn‚Äôt want to do any backdoor stuff if you know what I mean. It seemed like he lost control, and he tried to eitherway. When I expressed discomfort with it, he started sobbing saying extreme things like ‚ÄúI need to go to rehab I‚Äôm a terrible person‚Äù and slamming walls in my bathroom. I felt guilt and forgave him. \n\nAbout two weeks after this, I tried to play a small stupid prank on him and he slightly pushed my chest. After I laid in his bed sobbing from shock and confusion, he laid next to me hugging me and saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I blackout when I‚Äôm angry‚Äù and claimed he didn‚Äôt remember pushing me. He then went to shower and said ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre still here when I come back out‚Äù because he knew I was contemplating leaving. I stayed because the thought of how he would feel coming out of the bathroom and seeing an empty bed hurt my heart. \n\nAs time progressed there were moments he would snap at me out of no where for seemingly no reason. Like super angry in the flip of a switch. Even when I was just trying to help. He then apologized and said he ‚Äúdoes this all the time‚Äù and he‚Äôs ‚Äúworking on it‚Äù. \n\nWhenever he did something that made me uncomfortable and I confronted it, he would break down and sob. I‚Äôm talking like meltdown. \n\nAll of a sudden overtime I noticed he like started getting distant out of no where. Less compliments. Less physical touch. Less everything. His face got really cold if that makes sense. Just like emotionless. \n\nAbout a week before he broke up with me he stopped texting me. Making me feel crazy for wanting to know what he was thinking. He told me he needed a night alone to think of how he can ‚Äúbe a better partner for me‚Äù. He kept extending these nights, with no reasoning just leaving me confused. He said I ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt respecting his boundary for space‚Äù when in reality all I wanted was clarification to settle my anxiety. I stayed up for 48 hours at one point from anxiety over not knowing what was going on.\n\nA few days before the breakup, we were having an argument and I asked to step away alone for a second to catch my breath and clear my head before responding. I went into my bathroom. He came busting in 4 times, pushing me and pushing me despite me sobbing. I kept begging for space and he continued to berate me. I snapped and I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done with your shit‚Äù. He was like ‚Äúwow I cannot believe you said that to me‚Äù and began to attack on me for that. I said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs reactive gaslighting and you‚Äôre gaslighting me‚Äù. He looks me dead in the face and says ‚Äúno YOU‚ÄôRE gaslighting me.‚Äù Was i??? I was just so hurt. I told him to leave my room that night. \n\nFew days later, he says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to come to your room so we can talk‚Äù. He kept postponing the time, almost to deliberately hurt me. When he finally comes to my room, he says we‚Äôre done. Starts packing up all his stuff. He goes ‚Äúdon‚Äôt block me from leaving‚Äù, as if I would ever do that. Treating me like I‚Äôm crazy. I was begging him to stay. He looks at me and says ‚Äúgo get the help that you so badly need‚Äù. But before that he said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the love of my life‚Äù while packing his things up. As he left my room I said ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù. He says ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say the same‚Äù and walks off. He texted me the day before saying I love you. Like how can you not love someone anymore that easily? \n\nI texted him right after he left ‚ÄúI love you and this relationship, and this is worth working for and saving‚Äù. He responds ‚ÄúI loved you and I loved our relationship.‚Äù And then proceeds to block me on EVERYTHING. Literally everything. \n\nLess than 48 hours later he texts my roommate and says ‚ÄúI still love her. is she okay? I know I shouldn‚Äôt care but it hurts to know what she‚Äôs going through‚Äù. And you told me you didn‚Äôt love me less than 48 hours before? A few days before he ended things he told me he could see himself having kids with me. He made me feel crazy while breaking up with me like I was some psychotic person. \n\nI can‚Äôt help but wonder if I was in the wrong. Yes there were moments where I was too anxious and that displayed in my actions. But I NEVER had any bad intentions. I just needed reassurance. I blocked him incase he reaches out. I am closer with my friends again and weirdly enough I am talking more than I did when I was with him and being more like my normal extroverted self.\n\nHas anyone had similar experiences? How can someone go from supposedly loving you to leaving you in the worst way imaginable? Especially after I had opened up about my fear of abandonment due to my childhood trauma? \n\nabout a week and a half ish before our breakup he woke me up at night because he had a nightmare I completely ghosted him and blocked him on everything, and he told me it was horrible to dream about. So how could someone possibly do that to me and put me through their ‚Äúnightmare‚Äù? \n\nSomeone please give me your help and opinions. I haven‚Äôt opened up completely to anyone about this. But I feel like I may have been manipulated. Somehow, I still feel crazy."

                "body": "I (21F) was practically dumped at the alter when I was 18. My ex-fiance (then 20M) has a very controlling and possessive mother. His family at first welcomed me with open arms and accepted me like a daughter. I would take his younger sister do do things just her and me. I would spend Christmas Eve with them. They even had me house sit for then one time. It seemed like everything was going great. But I was his first girlfriend. And he was their first boy. They were a very religious family and had stereotyping gender roles. At the time I was also religious and was okay with the gender role of staying home and raising kids. I know better now, but I was young and naive then. But about a year into the relationship, I began having problems with their family. We would argue a lot. They would verbally harass me and say I was trying to take my ex away from them. They said the lied about ever loving me and said I would never be accepted into the family. My ex would just sit there and never defended me once. I avoided them like the plague until we got engaged. Then we went to them to announce our engagement. They said we were stupid and that it would never work out. We argued a lot. His sister made up some stupid shit about me bullying her which I never did. I loved her like a sister. It ended with me storming out crying. I begged my ex to never let me go through that again. I never spoke to them again. The wedding planning begins. My family started paying for stuff and we planned the wedding for 5 months after we got engaged, August 1st, 2020. But the day before rolls around. I couldn't get ahold of my ex. I tried calling and calling but he wouldn't answer. We had to go get his tux and set up the rehearsal dinner. I call my mom and start heading to her house. I lived on my own at that point. She went to his house and he told my mom first that the wedding was off. That he didn't want to lose his family and that they never approved of me. So pretty much he canceled our wedding the day before because mommy said no. She called me and told me the bad news. I had to hear it from my mom first, not even him. He and I eventually talked, but it was a total screaming match. We broke up and he over time payed my mom back for the wedding. He later on told the internet that I was the abusive one and that I wouldn't stop harassing him, which was a lie. I said one mean thing on a Google docs we shared and it was about his friend that later on drugged and raped me. Not him. Fast forward to Dec 2022. I'm with a wonderful man. We are living together and already planning our future. His family genuinely loves me and wants us to get married. I had massive anxiety going into new relationships about in-laws because of my exs family. I for months was scared that they would hate me too. But not all family's are like my exs. I'm even going to my bfs nieces ballet recital tomorrow. I still have trauma over this whole experience. It was one of the worst days of my life. I'm over him now and am madly in love with my bf. Just beware of mama's boys."

Anywhere in the incredibly long post below (sorry) where I‚Äôve verbalised my feelings to my wife, has made me feel very vulnerable and is not something I would typically do. Which is why I‚Äôm seeking advice, I‚Äôm obviously doing something wrong!\n\nI‚Äôve been with my wife for 10 years, married for a year and a half.\nI‚Äôm not going to pretend that at the beginning everything was great, because we‚Äôve always had issues around sex. Just as a little background (it‚Äôll be relevant later, I swear). I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs uncommon to have a different sex drive than your partner - which is where our sex issue lies. I find that I initiate 99% of the time, and probably get rejected 80%. I know she has body image issues and I‚Äôve tried to be supportive, she‚Äôs not comfortable being naked and I‚Äôve never pressured her to take off her clothes. I‚Äôve tried to make her feel more confident by getting her little sexy dresses that cover the areas she‚Äôs self conscious about. But the sex never really evolves naturally I.e., there‚Äôs never a mutual want for it, and when we do have sex I find its me putting in 90% of the foreplay. As much as I want sex, I want to have it with someone that actually wants it. Recently, the worry that she doesn‚Äôt want it and is just agreeing to it has been I pretty big block in my head and I haven‚Äôt been able to finish, which tbf probably makes her feel less sexy. But throughout our relationship the constant rejection has really effected my self esteem, to the point where I‚Äôm convinced she doesn‚Äôt find me attractive (also might play a roll in my below paranoia).\n\nRecently, a new issue has arisen where I‚Äôm finding her to not only be sexually distant but also emotionally. She has made some new friends, the first friends she‚Äôs made that she hasn‚Äôt met through me. That sounds controlling, but it‚Äôs not - she moved to my area and my friends became her friends. I don‚Äôt have an issue with her having new friends, but she has started spending every free second of her day talking to one of them. Ok, that‚Äôs an exaggeration, but she does text/video call with him all the time. I‚Äôve spoken to her about it and tried to be honest with how it‚Äôs making me a touch uncomfortable. I‚Äôll get in from work and she‚Äôll be on the PC gaming with him and that‚Äôs where she‚Äôll stay all night until she comes to bed, often that‚Äôs not till 3-4 am. She doesn‚Äôt stop playing to come eat dinner with me, so I end up feeling pretty lonely every night. I‚Äôve just started a new job and other than a ‚Äúhow was your day‚Äù she‚Äôs shown no interest in how it‚Äôs going. Another layer of secrecy is that she doesn‚Äôt text him, she snapchats him which could be completely innocent, but i find it a little disconcerting.\n\nThis week things have been very tense because I‚Äôve explained to her how I feel and the overarching response i get is that she doesn‚Äôt care. She hasn‚Äôt changed the way she‚Äôs acting at all and I‚Äôm just totally defeated by the situation. I had a little melt down on Wednesday. She was gaming, so I was texting her about how I‚Äôm feeling in the relationship (I find written communication easier as I can think about what I‚Äôm saying and if the words I‚Äôm choosing are right or not), and I can hear her in the other room laughing with her friends. I‚Äôm sure she wasn‚Äôt laughing about me, but I ended up feeling pretty hurt and like she didn‚Äôt really care about how upset I am and that our relationship isn‚Äôt very important to her.\n\nTo add to this, a couple of months ago I found a vibrator on top of her pc and it sewed a little seed of paranoia in my head (I told you the sex theme would return). We recently had people stay over and she tied it away. Now I‚Äôve just found it reappear in the same spot. Given our recent interactions, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs something I can speak to her about. I know I‚Äôll just be accused of not trusting her, but with the whole picture, I‚Äôm fairly confident the majority of people would have the same questions running through their head.\n\nAs much as I‚Äôm hurt about everything that‚Äôs unfolded this week, i don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready to completely give up. I must admit, I did ask her if she wanted a divorce during my mini-meltdown, because I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs taking the situation seriously (and still don‚Äôt). For me, if she was coming to me saying she was unhappy in the relationship my priority would be to understand and make steps to address the issues and hopefully work towards a stronger relationship. But is this a case of everyones different, or does she genuinely not care?\n\nAll I‚Äôm asking for is a little reassurance and attention from her. I‚Äôm struggling to get her to realise this. I‚Äôve outright told her the situation with this guy is playing on my insecurities, but that‚Äôs not what she hears. Her take home message is that I don‚Äôt want her to be friends with him and it devolves into an argument. She‚Äôs not really listening and I don‚Äôt want to have another argument about it. But every time I try to explain, nothing changes and next week I‚Äôll feel the same way. \n\nCan anyone give me any insights or advice? I‚Äôve made the assumption that I‚Äôm acting logically, but I‚Äôm emotionally invested so you never know‚Ä¶"

He says I‚Äôm so validation hungry and oftentimes accuses me of seeking validation from others or accuses me of wanting to cheat (he‚Äôs looked through my phone and I‚Äôve done neither and don‚Äôt plan to). \n\nI don‚Äôt know how to talk to him about how I‚Äôm feeling and our relationship without sounding selfish or not understanding. He gets extremely defensive and thinks I‚Äôm being unreasonable or not empathetic. I‚Äôm lost on how to move forward with the relationship in a healthy way. I don‚Äôt want him feeling so insecure that I‚Äôll cheat or seek validation elsewhere. I don‚Äôt want to mourn our sex life. I know this may sound dramatic but we‚Äôve been having sex since 14 and it literally went from 100 to 0. I also want to help him emotionally to get through this. He suffers with chronic illness so this new diagnosis has got him in a bad mental state. Any advice helps. Please try not to be too judgmental."

It affects my romantic relationship and my professional life.\n\nI am in a relationship for over a year and this boy is very dedicated. He cooks, he takes care of me, makes sure I am alright, knows how to communicate, is open to change, he loves me.\n\nA year ago I found out that a girl from his uni was flirting with my boyfriend. It was traumatic. It triggered my fear of abandonment and I started to obsess over this girl. We talked about it and he admited it finally, that they were pretty close and he chose to stop talking to her because it hurts me, but they still text about school from time to time and see each other at school. \n\nI am checking her social media everyday for at least 3 times and I am feeling so trapped in my body and mind.

We end up seeing each other pretty regularly in a group, but have never spoken outside the group except for one time when we hooked up. Before hooking up, he seemed really excited and said honestly we could do it again if I wanted to. We do the deed and a week passes. I reach out to him and ask if he'd be interested again since he offered and it wasn't bad. He responds with \"yeah sure\" which was definitely a turn-off, so I don't respond and nothing happens. We keep on seeing each other through other friends, and act like nothing happened. Then one day he tells me he wants to talk to me about something and it has to be in person. He says its an explanation and an apology, but I don't really know what he is apologizing for?\n\nAnyway, I kind of like him. He's kind of fun to hang out with and kind of reminds me of my ex. I want to pursue him, but would that make things weird between us? He is not great at communicating or talking in general (we don't talk a lot) . He is kind of cute also. He's mid height with brown hair and glasses and is not necessarily lean but is not very big either. \n\nShould I ask him out or will his talk reveal things that complicate the situation? Should I wait until he talks to me and then go from there? Why has it taken so long for us to have a talk, one that he requested? I am lost lol. \n\nTLDR; men are confusing and I want to pursue one but I don't know if I should or not"

At the start it was so perfect and we really had a beautiful connection.\n\nNow I'm wondering whether or not I even have a good future with him. Maybe a year or so in I came to realise that every one of his kids is a product of selfishness by their mother. As much as he loves them dearly, he never consented to having any of them.\n\nShe used to play mind games and manipulate the shit out of him. When he met her, he was young, about 18, and he had pretty much no support systems because his mother kicked him out a couple years prior to meeting his ex for something he didn't actually do (she realized her mistake later on and they're on very good terms now) and he was left homeless in the city for 6 months apparently. He witnessed and dealt with some really horrible things while being homeless. \n\nFor added context, his life before that was a bit tumultuous. He has severe ADHD and also witnessed a jumper at a job site that gave him very bad PTSD. \n\nFast forward to being with his ex, she got pregnant but he managed to convince her to get a termination. She did not react kindly to it. Fast forward a bit, he splits up with her, then 2 weeks after that she tells him she's pregnant. He's told me that he doesn't even remember having sex with her before he left her yet he's been confirmed that they are all his. \n\nThen like 8 months later she announced number 2 was coming and I believe he had his suspicions then but she would just tell him stuff like they didn't always use condoms or that he said he wanted another one or something\n\nThen after maybe a year or so they split up again. She convinced him to come back to her saying that she changed or whatever, mind game shit. Then maybe another year and a half goes by and, you guessed it. Pregnant again.\n\nApologies if this sounds messy because I'm literally talking about someone else's life story but I find myself asking myself... How the FUCK could someone, my boyfriend, be that incredibly stupid. You'd think after the first time she had something to do with it and not make that same mistake again, like I get it happens to people, but 3 times??? In fact almost 4!\n\nIt really makes me question whether or not someone who can fuck up so badly is actually worth spending my life with, to a degree it's actually embarrassing knowing all this information. \n\nBut despite all this, I stay with him because he is a really fucking good guy. In fact he's so good that this has been the most meaningful relationship I've ever been in. He is kind, so loving, always calls me beautiful and just genuinely cares about me and my own well-being. \n\nSomeone PLEASE tell me that I'm just an immature and judgemental asshole"

                "body": "I (18f) have recently been getting a little too close to my boyfriend's (18m) best friend (18m). I know this sounds very clich√©, like it's straight out of a fanfiction plot, but i need advice and there's no one irl that i feel that i can talk to about this.\n\nFor a little backstory, my boyfriend and i have been dating for six months now. The three of us in this story are in the same classes so we see each other very often. We're also into the same games so we play together with some other friends almost everyday. Bf and i, i'll refer to him as A, got close through games mostly, but a lot of it was by talking to each other all the time and realizing we have a lot in common. His friend, B, however, is pretty shy when he's around people he's not close to. Every friendship point i have with B is because of A, our common link. Because of A, the three of us end up going to the same gatherings, parties, and any sort of event.\nHere's the thing: i feel like i might be losing feelings for A. I've been feeling like this for a little while now, but it comes and goes. So many things he does now, mostly physical contact, give me \"the ick\", i cringe, i don't find him as attractive as i once have. And then, the feeling goes away and i think \"my, how could i ever even think about something like that?\"\n\nBut B has never been anything other than nice to me. He apologizes after accidentally interrupting me, he opens doors for me and waits for me to walk through them first (A has never done that), offers me help when i need it, et cetera. I've noticed B is quite an affectionate guy, he likes hugs and physical touch. When A wants to do that kind of stuff with me, I'm uncomfy, and think that that's just not my way of expressing love.\n\nB had never been touchy with me before today, which is part of the reason why I've been feeling guilty. B invited me, A, and some other common friends to his house. I'm the only one who showed up, everyone else was busy. As a result, we had a blast, played different games, talked about our interests, laughed, and overall had fun.\nB was getting more and more touchy. What started with jokingly bumping on my shoulder and tapping on my head ended with cupping my face a lot when he talked to me, holding my hand for longer than he should, laying his head on my shoulder and chest for not more than a couple seconds, and putting his hand on my waist for a moment. All while we played videogames together, sitting quite closely to each other. At a certain point, i realized that if i didnt have a boyfriend, i might've already kissed B.\n\nI felt so bad but being with B was such a light cozy feeling, i didn't worry about what he was doing or what i should be doing. I started to think that maybe, just maybe, he felt it too. But then i realized that he is naturally touchy and maybe that's all. I thought i might be starting to crush on him, but i couldn't help thinking that it's just a spur of the moment type of thing, and that I'd soon be grossed out by him.\n\nA is an amazing boyfriend and always has been. He's so madly in love with me. He's my first relationship and I'm his first girlfriend too, so we have a lot to learn, but i do feel overlooked sometimes, even though i know he doesn't do it on purpose. We have an absurd amount of things in common and he checks everything on my list, in theory. But i feel like I've cheated on him after today, because i shouldn't just be holding his friend's hand or even being that physically close to B.\n\nA knows i spent the day with B and didn't say anything remarkable about it. I feel so so guilty and I feel like I'm stuck. I don't think it's fair for me to stay with A, but cutting contact with A means not speaking to B either. Plus, there's a chance B is just being friendly. I don't know how to go on from now and I'm starting to feel physically sick from the guilt. I'll honestly take any help. \n\nTLDR: my boyfriend's best friend makes me feel more comfortable and less overlooked than my own boyfriend does, and i think we might have feelings for each other."

                "body": "My (21f) boyfriend (22m) have been dating for 3 years now. I met him when I went back to highschool after being out for 2 years. When I met him there was instantly just a strong connection between us but it became a bit rocky because I was afraid to get into a new relationship. I have never had the best experience with guys and just the year before I experienced something life changing and made my trust in men almost none existent. With him it was different though, but because of my actions we almost never dated.\n\nThen we fixed our problems and he eventually asked me out. Today we're in one of the most beautiful relationships and I honestly just love it. We've been through many ups and downs and always get through. I think it's also good to note that I have chronic anxiety and I tend to go into panicked episodes and tend to overthink. \n\nSo to my issue. For a while I've noticed he's been very distant and tends to push me one side. It started with our conversations, when we'd speak over the phone or in person, he rarely heard what I said, or completely changes the subject halfway through. He never notices but eventually I just started keeping quiet, even bringing it up was useless. Then he started chatting to me less, I'll send him a message and he'll reply hours later. It's always one word answers and he doesn't ever sound interested in anything I say. I tried changing topics, or keep the conversation going and he just doesn't seem interested.\n\nHe normally picks me up every weekend for one day and lately it's always been a problem. It used to be, now it's always maybe I'll pick you up. Granted he still makes an effort or just does it so I don't feel sad about it. But even when I'm there, he barely wants to spend time with me, talk to me. He's always on his phone. Always busy on tiktok. Before we started dating we spoke about how uncomfortable he is with people going through his phone because of stuff that happened in his past, I understand and was never nosy. But now it's just getting out of hand. We've been together for three years and he still doesn't allow me to be on it, fine that's not the problem but it's the other things he does. Like conviently it's always missing out of site when I'm around. If I ask if I can watch tiktoks on his phone, it's always 'dead'. How do I know this is a lie? Once I wanted to check the time on his phone, pressed the power button and it was off, so I just held the power button to power it on, it not only went on but showed 60% battery. Once he looked for his phone, panicked and I showed him I had it because I grabbed it for him and I can not forget the look on his face. I don't want to be suspicious and I trust him but now it's starting to bother me more and more.\n\n\nI have his email on my phone, his FB account is logged into my phone. So sometimes I can see what he's doing what all he's on, if he's online on FB and who he searches on FB, but I can't see that on any of his other socials. What started making me more suspicious and sad a but hurt with pertaining to this was I'd send him a message but then he he wouldn't reply to me but he's online everywhere else. One day I even saw he had telegram and busy chatting there but never had time to message me. Slowly but surely these things made me feel so insecure. What really contribute to it was when one day he was at my place I made him something to eat and brought to him, his back was to me. I saw him on tiktok and liking a girl's video. It didn't bother me at first but then I saw what she was doing in the video and the way he liked it and I just felt my heart drop. We had a conversation after that day but it just wasn't the same after that. I didn't feel comfortable anymore. I felt insecure. And that is also what lead to all these other things. And me looking for something, anything and I did end up finding some things that he explained but it was still a punch to the gut.\n\n\nAnd before you ask I have spoken to him, I do bring it up, I do try to speak to him about it. As for the attention part, I've practically begged him to stop treating me like this, to give me attention, I asked why he's chatting the way he is. And it lead to a conversation that's just slowly but surely turning my heart hard and I don't know what to do. He said his not interested in the conversations with me anymore. He asked me not to come to him this weekend because he feels we need space, ok rightfully so I don't mind but then I asked him then don't ignore me the entire time. \n\n\nI don't know what to do. I'm not completely innocent, I know. The way I bring up stuff, speak to him and act on my emotions can sometimes be extremely demeaning. And I'm trying to work on that. I'm trying not to be controlling or someone that is so clingy I guess. So I need advice, how do I go about working on this with him. I don't want to argue anymore. I want us to be better, I know constantly having to try to make me happy is not healthy for our relationship because he has his own life as well so I need advice on what I should do going forward. And please no, leave him or he's cheating replies, I want real hard truth advice on how to go about this as an adult, and how to mature in my relationship instead of just running away from this problem."

She basically thinks now that Greta doesn‚Äôt know her place as her friend and she doesn‚Äôt know boundaries because she says Greta made up lies about her because she had never said anything bad about Greta, and that she stated a boundary and that we basically shat all over her. \n\nShe stated that she needed a boyfriend who was going to defend her from people who say bad things about her.

For majority of the pregnancy its been a rough ride, I‚Äôve barely had any sleep to the point where every other day my eye is twitching from the lack of sleep. I‚Äôve come to realize when he rubs my back, I have better luck of falling asleep. Or even if he just talks about random stuff with me until I zone out and fall asleep. I learned to not ask for that during the week days when he has work the next morning. When he doesn‚Äôt get his full 8 hours of sleep, its not a pretty sight. So tonight, a friday, here I am having trouble sleeping. I asked him if he could either stay awake with me or if he could rub me. He rubs me for about a minute and falls asleep himself. Its only 10:30pm. When he‚Äôs out with friends, he can be up until 3am (this happens every other weekend). Another note: He schedules a surgery less than a month after his child is born, he sends me a text saying I have surgery on -insertdate-. Thats it, nothing else about it so I‚Äôm thinking okay he‚Äôs driving home, he‚Äôll let me know more about it when he comes home. I was wrong, 2 hours go by he‚Äôs not home, he went to his friends to tell them details about it first. So for those 2 hours I‚Äôm coming up with the worst cases. When he feels like the nesting part of the pregnancy is becoming too much work, he complains to his friends that I‚Äôm asking for too much/ doing too much. When I ask this one time on a night that he‚Äôll still be able to get his sleep, he tells me that I‚Äôm asking for too much. So obviously here I am crying while typing this up because hormones of the pregnancy make me emotional. Every time he goes off on me, I let it slide because I know he doesn‚Äôt mean it. I‚Äôll still straight up tell him he needs to calm down/take a breather before he continues. Sometimes it escalates a little too far and he will just keep talking about stuff I know he doesn‚Äôt realize he is saying. He‚Äôs been cutting down his smoking and drinking intake to try to be sober for when our baby is born. So it‚Äôs just withdrawal talking not him. It upsets me that when it comes down to trying to be there for me or helping me with something, he doesn‚Äôt have the time for it. But when it involves his friends! Its game changer, he does anything for them. I know I‚Äôm just being over dramatic, I dealt with my fair share of withdrawal at the beginning of this pregnancy as I stopped drinking and smoking cold turkey. It‚Äôs hard to deal with. Maybe I‚Äôm just jealous about the fact that he puts more towards his friends than me. That might just be my perspective. I kicked him out of room tonight and told him to either sleep on the couch or go to his friends house since it‚Äôs such an inconvenience to help me. Now I feel awful. \n\nI guess this was more a rant than anything."

We‚Äôd text all day and night, we hung out 5-6 times just casually over that month. We began dating officially after we kissed one of those nights, but before we had begun dating officially we had some deep conversations about both of us dealing with depression and previous experiences in relationships. \n\nShe had her first relationship earlier this year and was cheated on by him, they were only together for 6ish months. It‚Äôs been about 4 months since their breakup. \n\n3 days after we had became official, she broke things off because of outside factors among her not recognizing she‚Äôs still heartbroken over that relationship failing and an ongoing depressive episode. Which I fully understand, heartbreak on top of clinical depression sucks so we ended things on good/open ended terms. \n\nI did tell her though I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for me to remain close with her while I still have feelings for her to more or less protect myself from being hurt any more I guess. \n\nIt‚Äôs been about 2 ish weeks since we‚Äôve spoke. Deep down I would love to be close with this person and explore those emotions down the road, whenever she has healed from her heartbreak. We‚Äôve both acknowledged that there is chemistry. (Which reading back in my brain sounds like I‚Äôm waiting for her, but I‚Äôm not going out of my way to find anything atm as I‚Äôve uninstalled any dating app and don‚Äôt want to dive back into that rabbit hole.)\n\nNow the question is, I‚Äôd like to buy her some flowers maybe at the start of the new year as not only a way to kinda check in and see how she‚Äôs doing mentally in terms of her depression, but to show her that someone cares for her as a person, start the new year off with a little bit of joy and become friends again occasionally hanging out at some point. Do you think this is a good idea or do you think it could come off as too romantic and appear as if I‚Äôm only trying to date her again? \n\nI‚Äôm not trying to force anything romantic/relationship wise with her, knowing she‚Äôs emotionally unavailable."

Maybe a part of me thinks \"well at least he doesn't hit me.\" But I've been put in some very low places more than once. \nAnyway most recently, we had a great evening working on a project together. Later that night, after putting the kids to bed, I laid down after the long labor intensive project and attempted to sleep. He's never been one for foreplay. It's always a really brutish and he just kind of takes charges leaving very little for room for protest and I'm not always in the mood. Lately I haven't been at all but more often than not I just have a \"get it over with attitude.\" This night I actually just didn't respond and he just stopped and sat down and turned on the TV. \nEver since he's had this little attitude and barely speaks to me. \nI've had enough of his silent treatment baby antics and just don't pay attention anymore. There was a time he kept up his silent treatment for 3 weeks and i was in agony. I have 4 children to take care of; he has a mom. I'm done with it, so we all just went about our day and he brooded in our room for a day and a half. Nobody missed him. \nNot sure what I'm asking here other than to vent. Maybe... how have you ended things? I seem to hesitate a lot, a part of me is scared of his response. Im not very assertive when it comes to confrontation. But I am tired of the way our relationship works.  He's very absent. I could often be mistaken for a single mother. He has the freedom of a single man. I don't protest because I have my kids to take care. We have our schedules and our priorities. They're very loved and don't seem to miss him much when he's off doing his own thing. It's just the way it is. I SOMETIMES wish things could be different but he seems to have no desire to change things and i frankly feel held back by him. If he's not with us then step aside so we can keep moving, ya know."

And now recently, he's turned into a mean, defensive, and kinda fragile, person. It's like walking on eggshells whenever we talk because of how easily he angers. He's starting calling me names and worst of all starting blaming me for his suicidal thoughts. He brings up all the awful things I've done to him in the past when we first started dating because I didn't realize how emotionally fu*ked I was from my past, and it hurts to be constantly reminded of it even though I've changed.

Since we got together i noticed how he has a habit of staying awake until early morning and then sleeping the whole afternoon. It doesn't matter how often or long we fix this, it always comes back to it. \n\nWe both enjoy gaming a lot, in fact we met over our local gaming community. So staying awake a little longer than usual because you \"don't want to finish on a lose\" is nothing new for either of us. However i often feel like he's pushing himself (and me) to stay awake regardless if he's playing or not. If I'm tired he will encourage me to \"watch one more episode\" or offer me an energy drink. If i insist on sleeping he will tag along but usually it's already too late at that point. \nAlso when he finally sleeps, he sleeps extremely long (10hours at least) and snores the whole night, keeping me awake (If i ask him to, he'll sleep in the living room without complaining tho).\n \nHe has a history with depression and a lot of unresolved trauma from his family growing up (and still continuing) so I asked him if maybe this was some kind of unconscious \"punishment\" for himself whenever he's frustrated and he said it could be and he'd like a therapist but he'd have to wait way too long to get one. \n\nI'm just really exhausted. We're (again) at a point where it's 7:30am and I'm STILL awake. We wake up at 3pm and it's always a fight to get him out of bed. I'm missing all of my university classes because I'm just too tired to function with 2 hours of sleep everyday but he keeps pushing me to stay awake longer and longer every night. I haven't met my grandma in weeks because I'm always sleeping when she has time. I want to go to the doctor because of some problems but i can't even call to make an appointment because they already close when I'm awake. I hate this and i hate throwing my life away because of something so stupid. \n\nWe have had so many talks about this and he keeps apologizing and trying to get better but it never lasts. I don't blame him because i know it's affecting him too but I'm just so done. Has anyone else ever had this problem? How did you fix it?\n\nEdit: He fully acknowledges his problem and is actively trying to fix it. I don't want to break up over this, if i wanted to i could get back to my place anytime (I'm just here right now because he got a dog and i want to help for the first few weeks). I'm just looking for advice or people who have/had similar problems."

Getting mad at him, prohibiting him from going out etc) i just wish i didn‚Äôt feel this way anymore, i wish I could be happy for him.\nAnd it‚Äôs the small details that get me, i get fixated on the smallest details, like, he was invited to a friend‚Äôs presentation, i think its a acting thing, I‚Äôm not sure, i ask him to not give me much details or else i feel terrible, anyway, i was a bit surprised of how quickly he accepted to go, when i have my important events i have to beg him to come and I‚Äôm often replied with ‚Äúi will see‚Äù ‚Äúi will need to check with my mom‚Äù ‚Äúmy mom thinks I‚Äôve been going out too much‚Äù (obs: his mom is quite a controlling person and probably a narcissist, so he often has to walk around eggshells when it comes to her, i understand this and know it‚Äôs not his fault, also he has a serious disease that makes moving out basically impossible once he is extremely financially dependable on her and the health plan) (obs2: completely forgot to say I‚Äôm from a foreign country where it‚Äôs common to still live with our parents until we are settled, married or they die) but when it came to her thing it‚Äôs just ‚Äúyeah im going‚Äù\nTo be fair he probably had to talk to his mom as well and yeah, i ask him to not tell me too much about the details but holy shit it‚Äôs eating me inside the thought he is dedicating himself more to his friends than to me, my mind goes directly to ‚Äúyeah ofc im so annoying he probably wants to spend time with them and not with me‚Äù\nAnyway, i often talk to him about my feelings, he always explains himself (even tho he doesn‚Äôt have to) just to make me feel loved and a bit more calm, he is such a sweetheart,  feel like i got a jackpot and im so scared to lose him, I really need help to deal with all this jealousy, i am going to therapy for other issues and we haven‚Äôt touched that problem yet, my therapist is currently in a vacation and my bf has a bunch of end of the year hangouts he has to go, I really need a way to deal with it in the short term until i can talk about it with my therapist because all this jealousy, and honestly envy, is eating me inside :(\n\nTLDR: i am extremely jealous of my boyfriend and im looking for a way to deal with it."

It‚Äôs been almost 3 months since she‚Äôs left me but I still care about her. She said she needs to focus on herself and I respected that and let her go while letting her know that I‚Äôll always support and look out for her. Before we were together, she had mental health issues and was coping with dead of family, alcohol and sometimes drug abuse so I did my best to help her out and while we were together, she only had alcohol casually which isn‚Äôt the best but better than before. While she was suffering, her friends were shitty, letting her get black out drunk and do drugs which ultimately led to her being taken advantage of and dumped on the side of the road. She‚Äôs told me about this trauma wishing she didn‚Äôt go through that but since she‚Äôs broken up with me, she‚Äôs been going out with those same friends, drinking, smoking and doing drugs again. I felt concerned and offered her help but she wouldn‚Äôt let me help and continues to move backwards away from her goal. This deeply saddens me because I see so much potential in her as a person and just knowing about what she‚Äôs doing is hurting me. I‚Äôve offered help about 20 times post break up because I care and miss her but she keeps doing the same shit with the same people who won‚Äôt help her reach her goal but rather take her away from it.

My fianc√© (35M) and I are planning to get married next year. He is planning on having 5 groomsmen and deciding between two of them to be best man. I think he is leaning towards his friend Greg (30s M).\n\nI don‚Äôt particularly like Greg, and Greg doesn‚Äôt seem to like me either. When my fianc√© and I were first dating, we got along. However, Greg made a few racist comments, and I don‚Äôt have the time or energy to hang out with people like that. (I‚Äôm black, fianc√© is white).\n\n6 months ago, Greg said something racist. Fianc√© was talking to other people and didn‚Äôt notice. Two weeks after the comment was said, a big group of my fianc√©‚Äôs friends (including Greg) were going out to brunch. Still hurt, I told my fianc√© I planned to stay home and why. He understood. However, a month later, he felt the need to address the racist comment with Greg even though I asked him not to. Greg got defensive, as expected. Greg and I have talked once since then to ‚Äúmake up,‚Äù but I can tell he doesn‚Äôt like me and thinks I‚Äôm oversensitive. \n\nI don‚Äôt need Greg‚Äôs friendship. My fianc√© goes to hang out with him alone. And honestly, I don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs one of 200 guests at our wedding. However, I really don‚Äôt want him giving a speech at my reception. I don‚Äôt want someone who doesn‚Äôt like me speaking at my wedding. \n\nI‚Äôd like my fianc√© to either pick a different friend to be best man, and that guy can give a speech. Or, he can choose Greg and we can skip the speeches. How do I communicate that to him?\n\nFor the record, I am indifferent about speeches. If his best man gives a speech, then I‚Äôll ask my MOH to as well. However, I‚Äôm also fine skipping that tradition. \n\nTLDR: I don‚Äôt like the guy my fianc√© wants to choose as his best man because I think he‚Äôs racist.

My friend and I often one pays Uber there one pays Uber home. However, this time we offered to pick her up and drop her home. We got to her house and she made our Uber wait 10 mins because she wasn't ready in time, and did not even say thank you for waiting. She didn't offer to pay for any of the Ubers, even though I know she does not work at least say thank you?? \n\nWe got to the restaurant and ordered a massive cocktail (fishbowl), my friend and I paid and she said she didn't have money but still drank out of it?? We got to the second spot and ordered another fishbowl which was $70 and my friend and I split again and she continued to sip from it and take a lot of alcohol as if she contributed, still no thank you. Throughout the night she didn't ask any questions about me and I couldn't ask anything about her. I shrugged it off because I thought she would have been nervous. Uber home was $77 and she did not once offer to pay, or said thank you. \n\nThe first interaction really put a sour taste in my mouth about her. Again, I thought she maybe nervous so I tried again for my friend to like her. We organised another one for our my main friends birthday and yep same thing happened again, talked about herself all night but it's not even about herself she would talk about weird shit that none of us could respond too. I got an Uber home on my own because I couldn't handle her. I find her very immature for a 22 year old, she had a panic attack when she kissed a boy in a night club?? then told everyone all about it.. like it's just a kiss. She calls me a skank because i've got experience with men, claims she's joking but I don't think she is. \n\nThe next catch up is NYD for a festival and I'm dreading it, I only invited her for my friends sake because I know she likes her. However, after NYD I am no longer going to hangout with her. She's just too immature for me. She's nothing like our friend, she doesn't let us talk, doesn't ask questions about us etc. \n\nHow do I tell my friend without being an asshole I cannot handle her?"

Seriously! Why me man? Turns out he‚Äôs declared a celibate act upon himself and is turning any women away. Blocked a girl of his right in front of me, to prove his commitment to this. Mind you I don‚Äôt want to disrespect him and his decision and push him but I don‚Äôt know what to do !!\n\nMy friends have noticed my little feelings towards him, but they say that they see the same in how he feels about me. But I‚Äôm not too certain, yes he does look at me sometimes with these eyes of just full of infatuation and I don‚Äôt know, I can‚Äôt read him that well. However, he does look at me when I‚Äôm not looking, I‚Äôve caught him looking out of the corner of my eye before. \n\nThese are just a few things that has happened in the last 4 months and I don‚Äôt know whether to take these as signs or just making it up in my head. For starters I was over at his place not too long ago and we were watching a movie and I don‚Äôt know to this day how this happened but he ended up scratching my back while I was laying down next to him. There was another scenario where I was having a really bad time at an adult outing and I needed to step outside, he came to find me crying, he didn‚Äôt say anything besides that he‚Äôs sorry and just hugged me. From me crying, he felt bad and began to cry with me, apologizing for apparently how he‚Äôs treated me in the past and he feels terrible and wants to treat me better. We sat there like that for 2 whole hours, there was moments we sat in silence and others we were laughing or crying. But ever since that night, nether of us brought it up again. Now this happened not too long ago, this one. I was having a really bad day, hard week of just one terrible thing after another, I asked for just a simple quick hug to stop crying and he came over and hugged me, like I asked. Picture this: he‚Äôs over 6ft and I‚Äôm around 5‚Äô4-5‚Äô5 if I‚Äôm lucky, but how he grabbed me and pulled me into his chest was so comforting. I put my arms through his jacket and around his back, I laid my head against his chest and his heart was beating so fast! Sounded like a race track was nearby. He also held me back and around my waist, he then rested his chin onto the top of my head, then eventually his head onto mine. We sat there in silence I would say a solid 3 minutes. It was so comfortable and relaxing, he told me anytime I need a hug like that to let him know, now mind you he is like the least physical attention person I know. He hates it even if I poke him as a joke, but a hug?? Like that! Ughh so confusing! \n\nHe also decided to tell me that he might be wanting a relationship with someone, but no one in particular, but he wants to stick to his vow since it has done alot for him. What am I supposed to do? I don‚Äôt know if I should tell him or not, and if so, how do I tell him? I would like to respect and follow his decision in celibacy but I do want him to know how I feel.

                "body": "Evening all, hoping that I'm posting this in the right place. Also my apologies for any typos, on mobile.\n\nMy girlfriend (26F) and I (27M) have been together for going on two years now. When we first started dating she told me right up front that she had ADHD, as well as anxiety disorders. I struggle with the latter as well so I'm certainly not one to judge, and at the time she seemed to have a good handle on her mental health.\n\nFor the first year and a half or so occasionally she'd have minor issues with remembering things, getting distracted from time to time, sometimes getting a little overwhelmed/over stimulated, but all in all was doing well. That started to change about six months ago. She started forgetting things like what days she was working, putting off tasks until the last possible minute and then spiraling down into panic attacks because of it. She'll get distracted in the middle of a conversation to look at something on her phone and forget what we were talking about. \n\nNow I don't have ADHD, so won't claim to understand exactly what she's going through or how much of a struggle it is, but I'm still very concerned. It's not just innocent distractions and sometimes getting a little over stimulated. She has left a hot iron plugged in until it almost melted through the ironing board. A while ago she forgot to close the fridge door and didn't notice until everything had spoiled inside (this has happened twice). This genuinely makes me worried for her safety at times. I also have the feeling it's affected her anxiety as well. She doesn't like going to the store or being out in public unless I'm there as well to help calm her down. She asks me to make phone calls on her behalf because she's too anxious to do it herself. \n\nI brought up my concerns with her, explaining that I care deeply about her and want her to do well, and that it might be beneficial for her to seek out some sort of help, whether that be therapy or medication or something else. When I told her how I felt she got very apologetic and kept saying how it's all her fault, how she feels like a terrible person, etc etc. I tried helping her find a therapist (as she had expressed a desire to get back into therapy on a few occasions). But each time I showed her one that seemed promising, including ones specializing in adult ADHD, she had a reason to turn them down. They looked too old, they didn't seem nice, they looked scary, etc etc. She seems even more opposed to medication, saying that it'll make her feel even worse.\n\nI feel awful saying this but it's starting to affect me as well. There are days I feel more like a parent than her partner. Constantly having to make sure she's not forgetting things, getting distracted in the middle of important tasks. And the fact that she seems to look for any reason to avoid getting help is getting a bit disheartening. I really want her to feel better and be happier, since I can tell this is starting to impact her overall mental health and self-image. \n\nThat's where I could really use some help. I want to communicate this to her without coming across as selfish or like I'm blaming her for these issues, because I understand she doesn't have direct control over them. Generally speaking we have great communication but I'm just trying to find a way to get my concerns across without sounding like an absolute toolbag.\n\nTl;Dr: Girlfriend is really struggling with ADHD and it's starting to affect our relationship, but doesn't seem to want to get any sort of help for it."

He even showed me the place he wanted to marry me on his parents land. We did not have the best relationship at times but I have never been so in love in my life. He was my best friend and I have never had that in a lover before. He has alcohol abuse issues, i have mental health issues, i was recently diagnosed with a chronic illness but prior to that in our relationship I was sick a lot and didn‚Äôt know why. I had lost my job and dropped out of school. I was a hot mess and so was he in ways. He got in trouble with the law a couple times with OWIs. We came to a point where it got hard. Both of our lives got hard personally and we couldn‚Äôt stick it out anymore. Not to mention we had a lot of times where we would just bicker and fight about random things. We both had hopped relationship after relationship prior to each other and neither of us had been alone for more then a couple months just being single prior to each other in a few years. It was a hard decision to make and he was the one who called it in the end. Said he needed to just be alone right now in life. It‚Äôs only been 4 months but I have struggled. A lot. That being said we broke up the first time about 6 months ago and we were on and off for the last two months. We were truly each others only friends and loved each other. It was hard staying apart especially when life hit both of us so hard after the initial breakup 6 months ago. I still have so much love for him as he does for me. He was truly the first person who I fully believed was the one. Like he was it for me. We overcame so much in our relationship for it to come down to just needing to be alone. And that‚Äôs okay because I want what‚Äôs best for him but it‚Äôs still kinda heartbreaking. I was so close with his family and he asked his sister how she knew her husband was the one when we were together (don‚Äôt ask how I know that haha).\n\nFast forward, my now boyfriend is in the military. He is currently out of the country on a rotation. We have been officially dating two months. He has been a good friend of mine for over three years. He helped me through a lot of relationship problems with said ex above. I wouldn‚Äôt have met my most recent ex if it weren‚Äôt for my current boyfriend. They were friends too. He has also just been there for me the past three years in general. When me and said ex broke up he was kinda my only friend. He helped me heal a lot. He was also engaged at one point and it didn‚Äôt work out so I know he has the level of understanding of love i guess if that makes sense. We have always had somewhat of a chemistry. Like I said we were good friends. But you have to remember I am an adult and not every male is seen that way for me. I never saw him like this prior to us dating. We just got really close and talked all the time. He became my best friend and then more. I thought I was over my ex because when I thought about my future with my now boyfriend it gave me hope again. I still have my ex on social media. He is not blocked from anything. We left our relationship with a lot of love but he never gave me a reason to believe he would ever want to try again. When it ended I honestly just thought to myself that if he couldn‚Äôt stick it out with me now he never will be able too and that‚Äôs not a quality I want in a husband. I will always be rooting for him and be there for him if he needed anything but it just would never be the way it used too. I reached out to my ex for closure because I thought I was over it but I wasn‚Äôt. And the more questions I asked the more questions I had. He said he didn‚Äôt see me that way anymore but still had a lot of love for me. That I needed to let him go. That me and my bow boyfriend would never survive long distance for the next two years and that he would consider dating me again in the future if he felt like we could work. But right now is not the time for him and he is trying to just be alone in this chapter if his life. My current boyfriend like I said has always been a good friend and I turned to him for advice often. He is updated on the situation and told me he understands. Whatever I do he understands. What did I do? I seriously don‚Äôt even have a gut instinct here. I am at a complete loss. My current boyfriend makes me very happy but I‚Äôm clearly not over my ex year and that‚Äôs not fair to my current boyfriend. He makes me so happy and I know we would have such an amazing future without a doubt. Either way I lose in a way."

So I'm gonna preface this with my friends and u gave him the nickname chicken, cuase he's loud, obnoxious, and he can be a little slow from time to time. I've taken the advice I received last time, and am now actually going to be helping a bit in another class we share, where he is most definitely failing. Other things of note with chicken: he sprayed me with the hose and used it as an excuse to make a pun out of my name, and also I have family members who have noticed chiken staring at ne when we run into each other in public.

                "body": "I'm (29) in desperate need of advice. Keeping things as concise as possible, it'll still be long, so here's the rundown:\n\nI met this person in middle school, and liked talking to them in classes we had together. Had no intention of hanging out outside of school. One day when my dad comes to pick me up from school he sees us talking and invites them over on my behalf, thinking it's what I'd want. I didn't. But I didn't know how to express that I wanted what I'd now call a \"work friendship.\" Can have a great time chatting at work, but not want to hang out outside of work.\nBut we did become much closer, and spent more time together outside of school, even if at times I found them annoying, or clueless, or bewildering. I also cared about them and wanted them to be doing well. And as a picky asshole that keeps few friends, they ended up someone I spent a lot of time with. And as a teenager with few friends, I didn't have much reference for how most people are.\n\nHad to move away for a few years at 18, and am bad at long distance anything. \n\nMoved back and into a house with them and others to get out of a bad situation, they really did me a solid.\n\nAfter spending so much time away, certain aspects of their personality stuck out a lot more, like how hyper defensive they still were. Occasionally their tone can be so combative that it makes me, someone with a weak spine, not want to say anything contrary, even if it's something that'd be good for them to hear. And it sucks for us both because I know they genuinely don't intend for their tone to sound as such, but it's the kind of thing that flips a switch that I'm still learning to get control of, where I'll just automatically avoid whatever pressed their button. They even straight up asked me if they get overly defensive/combative and I believe my response was \"not really.\"\n\nAnd then there was them talking to our landlord without going over it with the group first even though how they see one of us would impact all of us. And then basically the same thing happening at the next house. Covid had just hit and they asked the landlord about pausing rent temporarily, without talking to the whole house first. They ended up moving out anyway, and when the lease was up the landlords told us they \"want to try to sell instead of rent.\" Even though they liked us up until that point, and the place is still being rented out. Their message is of course not for sure the reason we couldn't renew, but it couldn't have helped, and then we had to find a new place during the first summer of the pandemic. And their cousin that had moved in with us all explicitly so the two of them could find a place together was also left with us, which was a bit hard because their cousin was living on disability payments and couldn't contribute as much towards rent.\n\nSo then a year or so later, we'd had a tiny bit of chat on messenger in the mean time but hadn't seen each other and they wanted to hang out. And I said I didn't want to. They asked when I did want to. And I said that I didn't. And today they finally asked why. It'd felt really slow and like a long time coming but at the same time kinda fast and all at once. I think they're a good person, and I wish them the best, but I don't wish to spend time with them or to be in communication.\n\nLike. I think our whole connection was basically neurodivergently hyperfixating on something we both liked and infodumping back and forth, and having some good conversation, and that was all I wanted. And I don't need that now. And now I have friends whom I care for in a much different way. It doesn't matter if we like the same things. Or if we're states apart. I want to hear about their personal lives. And there aren't times when I question if I like or respect them. And I don't know how to answer my old friends question of why I've broken things off in a way that is compassionate, and not \"too much\". \n\nThis feels like one of those things where I'm in so deep I just can't see the simple solution. Please advise me. I feel like an idiot."

He was previously living in a shared apartment with his coworkers, but just lost his job recently. Since he does not have a work permit in the states, so it is pretty difficult to find a job and/or an apartment. He just moved in with us temporarily in our apartment which is a loft style 1 bedroom. It‚Äôs pretty small. We‚Äôve been dating for 2 years now, and live together now.\n \nHer dad  lived with us last year for about 2 months for the same reason, and I hated every moment of it. \n \nI work full time from home, and my girlfriend also works full time at a local salon. We make enough to support ourselves and our dog. \n \nAny advice given the situation and the personality traits below? \n \nMyself: I am a hard working introvert. I work a 9-5 and I try to spend my spare time to develop my personal work, creative endeavors, small online business, writing etc. I am low in compassion, and believe each person should be responsible for their own fate. My relationship with my parents and my siblings are good. I love my girlfriend, would love to spend my life with her and be there for her. I don‚Äôt have many friends.\n \nGirlfriend: She is a sweet girl with a kind heart. She‚Äôs not really the type that wants success. She wants happiness and comfort. She works full time at a nail salon. Her mom does not talk to her, and their relationship is estranged. All she has is a few friends and me, also her dad. It seems she loves me, and wants to see a future with me. She lived most her life with her auntie and her relatives back in our home country till she was 17. Since she is the more compassionate one, she wants to help her dad out and situate him as best as we could. \n \nHer dad: He is a soft spoken, nice guy, and wants to help out here and there if he can. He has a gambling addiction problem which I think is why he‚Äôs a deadbeat at this age right now. The dude just never seemed to have taken any responsibility in his life to my eyes. He left my girlfriend when she was 5 years old to work abroad and was never there for her. Now that we live in the same country, he is closeby to us. He lived in a different state till last year. \n \nI just don‚Äôt know how to handle this situation. What I would like is to have him get away from us since I feel as though he shouldn‚Äôt be near my girlfriend nor myself since he left her as a child and did not fulfill his duty as a father. I also want to focus more on my life‚Äôs work without worrying about him. I also feel it is unfair for me to take care of someone such as him while I have goals of my own and my own family (siblings 21F and 11F) to focus on and be there for them although my parents are currently capable yet aging. \n \nMy options are: \n \nSuck it up and work something out for the poor man. Help the guy out. This option is near impossible and would put my own pursuit of happiness at risk.\nBreakup with my girl, and be on with my life. Part of me thinks I shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with this, and I can do better. \nPersuade my girlfriend to have her dad move back to the state he once lived till he moved here last year. I can persuade her with reasons of him leaving her as a young child. I just don‚Äôt feel like it is up to me to make that decision. \n \nI would greatly appreciate your opinions on this one, fellow humans. \n \nThank you, \n \nYours truly"

A few weeks pass and we're just chatting about our day. I asked if he was going to do anything for the day, and he replied saying he already planned to watch the movie with his friends. He invited me, but the showing was at 12am. Not only is it a bit late, but I have an exam tomorrow in the morning, which he knows about. I asked why they were going so late and he just shrugged without giving me an explanation. I was bummed out because I really wanted to watch it with him, but he said it wasn't his fault I had an exam tomorrow. He also said he planned to go with his friends in the first place, so it wouldn't make much of a difference if I went or not because he would have a good time either way.\n\nNow, I know that this situation is not bad. But throughout our relationship, I have always felt less important than his friends. I feel like a second option, especially within the time when I invited him to go rollerskating with me and he said maybe. Maybe because if his friends plan to do something with him, he'll go. But if they don't, then he'll come hangout with me.\n\nAnother thing is, I tend to make majority of our plans/dates. I suggest new things for us to do and all he can say is \"sure\" or \"I don't mind.\" It is always up to me to come up with something to do because if not, then we'll stay at home and just watch Netflix. Rarely does he actually mention something new for us to do or show something he is interested in. It depends on what I want to do, and if he doesn't want to do it then we just don't do anything. Meanwhile, he is going out to parties, bars, escape rooms and all that with his friends. So I was hurt that the one time he wants to do something that excites him, he chooses to do it with his friends.\n\nI'm confused because he says he loves me a lot and is trying to make me happy, but I'm unsure how to feel.\n\nedit: i guess for context, we've been dating for a year"

My family consists of difficult people along with problems too. So, he plans to get an apartment, but only said ‚Äúyou can come over whenever I invite you, and we can hang out as friends.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think he understands how much this breaks my heart, and he said living here makes him uncomfortable and awkward.

Take care.‚Äù\n\nI know this sounds bad but part of me doesn‚Äôt believe his congrats and I also want him to hurt more, so leaving him hanging feels like better punishment. \n\nI am extremely loyal and would never cheat on my husband emotionally or physically but part of me wonders why in the heck this ex caused so much damage and turmoil then comes around only to find out I‚Äôm married.

But once we started to talk she went completely off on me and told me how disrespectful and rude I have been ever since the engagement. This has been building up for some time and instead of communicating with me, she decided to blow up on me. She said a bunch of stuff such as ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt send me a thank you card from your wedding‚Äù or ‚Äúwhen you were in the hospital you didn‚Äôt communicate enough‚Äù (was in the hospital for 4 days due to me having a high-risk pregnancy. I had sent two updates one describing why I was in the hospital and another saying I‚Äôm free). She even said that once my child is born I will not let her see her. She criticized my marriage because I hadn‚Äôt decided if I will be taking my husband's last name. She also mentioned that I have been on my phone a lot more at social gatherings (literally half the people at these gatherings are on the phone). She had even brought up something that had happened a year ago. She had said a lot more shit, but that‚Äôs the main issue. When I apologized she stated, ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt sound like a sincere apology.‚Äù Throughout the entire conversation, I kept apologizing and said this is the first time I‚Äôm hearing about this. She kept jumping back and forth between inviting to uninviting me to Christmas. When she had uninvited me to Christmas I had said: ‚Äúwell if that‚Äôs how you feel I understand. I can‚Äôt make you like me. I will respect your wishes‚Äù she then proceeds to say to me ‚Äúwell why don‚Äôt you care that I‚Äôm not inviting you to Christmas. It sounds like you don‚Äôt care about me.‚Äù Well, regardless I couldn‚Äôt win the conversation. My husband was in the room the entire time she had said these things.

Childcare is very much a shared task and he‚Äôs a great and very involved dad. \n\nWhile I‚Äôve been off on parental leave, I‚Äôve been happy to take on a larger share since I‚Äôm home most of the day and my husband works in a labour-intensive job so is often tired at the end of the day.

otherwise, we just wouldn't work properly. i tried to tell him that i still don't feel at all comfortable, but instead of convincing him, he argued that i need to stop talking so much about myself and forget about how i felt and so i just gave in.\n\nwhat got me to reevaluate everything was after my grandmother passed away which was two weeks ago and have as a result, traumatized me to the point where i was unable to eat or get out of bed. that night, when i called him that night, crying to the point where i couldn‚Äôt breathe and just wanted to get some comfort, he slept out on me so i took some sleeping pills and sobbed myself to sleep. and this happened for a week straight where he wouldn‚Äôt acknowledge how i might‚Äôve been feeling and not being there for me (he knows what happened through a friend). i finally talked to him about it and said that i‚Äôm not trying to be dependent but simply need a listening ear; he doesn't need to give me anything, just some attention for at least a short while. instead, he became angry, telling me that he works and is too tired to listen to me cry but i apparently wouldn‚Äôt understand because i lost my job. he then said i should just be grateful and instead pointed out the things that i do that annoy him.\n\ni‚Äôve had so much pent up inside of me because of my grandmothers death and every thing else i was forced to suppress and i‚Äôm just burnt out. he‚Äôs also planning on proposing next year and getting a place for us but i‚Äôm not sure. i simply just never feel understood and am always afraid to express my feelings out loud because we would just fight so it isn‚Äôt worth it. \n\nhe also bought a plane ticket for me to fly out and see him in two days. i‚Äôm scared and sick just thinking about it, but he has been over the moon excited, telling everyone around him and even breaking down in tears from being so excited. i‚Äôm still in pain and grieving and i‚Äôm just plain sick of this. i just want out because it‚Äôs ruining my mental health and making me lose myself.\n\ni want to know whether i‚Äôm overreacting, if i should still go see him, and if not, how can i break the news to him so last minute that i‚Äôm not coming to visit?"

She won‚Äôt so couples therapy either (she suggested it once, and I asked her to just talk to me first and it didn‚Äôt happen). \n\nI know I‚Äôm going to have to have a conversation with her, as she said she wanted to reevaluate, and her mindset is going to be to end things because she said we tried and it‚Äôs not working. I don‚Äôt feel like she has. What options exist to get her to try therapy before giving up?\n\nTLDR: ex and I broke up and she said she has tried. How can I get her to give therapy a chance before giving up on this? Or is there a better option?"

Started as just getting tipsy and being obnoxious. Then turned to an angry drunk. Then this lead to nights where he would be out until 4 am. We separated for a very short period a few months back (2 weeks). He had been sober with just 1 or 2 slip ups. Then I found a few times that he lied to me. I knew because I found the evidence of the plastic can holders. But no cans. Or I could smell it on him and he would act like nothing was out of the ordinary. I have been trying to work really hard at being a good wife and not bringing up any conflict. I thought things were good until today. He left the house before I got home from work and he told me he was going to see family. But, I know he is now at a bar. It is 10:30 PM and he had said he would be home at 7. No calls or texts since 5 PM. I have reached the end of my rope. I don‚Äôt know if I should keep trying or if this is a lost cause and I am just holding onto what is no longer there. Just this past summer I had to reach out to family for help as I felt like I was losing my mind. He has not physically hurt me but, I cant lie.

I‚Äôm not a person who believes in soulmates but I believe he‚Äôs the one for me after countless trial and error, between me, him and different men in my life who have come and gone. Nobody has ever treated me as wonderful as he does and I feel like we balance one another out. But the relationship is online. We met playing video games and that‚Äôs how we became friends and bonded during the early friendship of our relationship, after multiple calls, FaceTimes, etc, we know very well that neither of us are pedophiles and the claims about our daily life are true. To be honest, I‚Äôm attached, and I don‚Äôt want to admit that because I believe that can be unhealthy however I am absolutely obsessed over him. And over the few years he‚Äôs shown he‚Äôs obsessed for me. \nThen there‚Äôs his family, who absolutely hates me. They‚Äôve never met me, but they go through his phone (especially recently) even when he‚Äôs been a legal adult (he‚Äôs currently saving up to move out). It‚Äôs frustrating and I‚Äôve tried to tell him they cannot legally do that, it‚Äôs his phone, he owns it, he‚Äôs a legal adult. But their content on the fact that I‚Äôm a 60 something year old man, and it‚Äôs honestly frustrating, even after I‚Äôve provided evidence that I‚Äôm not. They‚Äôve spam called me multiple times, have taken my boyfriend‚Äôs phone and sent threats through our messages pretending to be him. \nAnd there‚Äôs his best friend. He‚Äôs told me he‚Äôs been friends with this guy for a very long time, and I‚Äôve never had a problem with him. I‚Äôve always been completely okay with it and I love that he has friends, it‚Äôs good. But then he also tried to get involved in our relationship. My boyfriend never did really talk about me to his best friend, then he discovered our text. He immediately took to trying to make us breakup, he couldn‚Äôt bother to confide in his ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù about his opinions on our relationship but instead chose to just try to break us up. He‚Äôs done this numerous times, has called me numerous times. \nHe‚Äôs gone so far as to telling my boyfriend that he was dead to him, because of this. My boyfriend made up however even though I advised him not to, because I don‚Äôt think a true friend would do that. It feels unfair, like he‚Äôs gaslighting my boyfriend because my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt really have any other friends. \nYesterday another event like this happened, this time involving his mother. I was so stressed, so upset, I was ready to breakup with my boyfriend because I‚Äôve been constantly berated and it‚Äôs as if he‚Äôs not even standing up for me. I understand he loves his family and friends, and I love mine, but this just feels wrong. I asked him, who he would choose, me or his best friend. I wanted to know, I love him with everything and I‚Äôd choose him over my best friend because he‚Äôs the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. He chose his best friend. I was absolutely distraught, and I don‚Äôt know what to do. Since then it‚Äôs been rough, today we‚Äôve been distanced. \nI‚Äôve honestly been crying so much, I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve never been in love with someone like this nor have I had something like this happen where I‚Äôve felt so cornered, I went to making him choose.

I had never been in a relationship before in my life, and have never even attempted to talk to a girl before in my life.\n\nAnyways I match with this girl on Bumble, we hit it off, and I invite her to go out for coffee. I was incredibly anxious to the point where I was shaking, but the date went fantastic. We both had strong career goals,  values, and interests, she laughs at everything I say, etc... She texted me immediately after she got home, told me she told all of her friends about me and said I shouldn't be nervous at all around her. Said she thought I was the cutest thing in the world and we could take things slow as I get into my first relationship.\n\nFast forward to the second date. We had been messaging constantly the week before. We go out for Breakfast, then go back to her place. The date again goes great and we hang out the entire day. We're also making out for what must have been hours. I'm thinking that she is looking for a relationship out of this because she's been sending me Snapchats of her family, her baby nieces, and nephews, telling me how her friends think I'm the real catch. The following week were sending snaps back and forth constantly again.\n\nOn the third date, I invite her back to my place, I cook dinner for the two of us, and we're watching a movie. The date seems to be going great, we're making out again. But then she drops a bomb and says she doesn't want any exclusivity because she's going away for 2 months for her job, and she wasn't ready to get back into a relationship after her 7-year breakup with an abusive ex and was just seeing what other options were out there. She said that she is still seeing multiple guys whilst talking to me and that if I was looking for a relationship then we shouldn't have sex as she didn't want to see me get hurt as she (correctly) assumed I'd fall for her pretty quickly.\n\nI thought about it for a bit as we were together, and we did end up having sex (The first time I've ever had sex if that matters...). I ask if she'd like to hang out again and she said she'd love to. But now I have absolutely no idea what to do. The day after she's still sending me Snapchats of her family and friends, talking about me, and asking about what my friends thought about her.\n\nThe thing is, I would like to be exclusive with this girl, but she's going away for 2 months in a few weeks and was pretty open about how she had been seeing other guys. It's only been 3 dates, but I was wondering if I should keep going or just cut ties completely. If I'm being honest with myself, I do not want to put more effort into more dates if she's sleeping with like 2 or 3 other guys still, and is just going to ditch me when she goes away for 2 months. She said she'd never consider being exclusive with me right now as she just didn't know what she wants yet, but in the future, she'd be open to a relationship, just not right now. Also, we are probably going to have sex again on the fourth date.\n\nI'm just confused because she's talking to me constantly about her family and friends, and vice versa for me as well. Is she doing this with the other guys that she's been talking to? I feel like if I'm just a FWB, then she wouldn't be sending me pictures of her friends and family constantly. I think at the moment I'm just a passing fling for her, but I was wondering what all of your opinions were. Should I cut ties or keep pursuing it? I really do not have the energy to focus on multiple girls either, so that is completely out of the question.  I don't think I would want to anyways. \n\nBut yeah, should I go on the fourth date or should I cut ties?\n\nTLDR: First relationship ever goes on for 3 great dates. The girl is leaving for 2 months in a few weeks and is still seeing other guys, doesn't want exclusivity, and is unsure of what she wants. I want a relationship, so I am wondering if I should still keep in contact with this girl."

He left his job of over 2 years and went to a job that offered less hours and less pay but I supported him because it was something he was having fun doing. He was only there for 2 weeks before he was let go because of a \"misunderstanding\". He was out of work for 3 weeks. I encouraged him to apply at my work as well as any other places that were jobs he was more familiar with. He applied at mine and waited... and waited for 3 weeks until they finally got him in for orientation. He left orientation early and has fought this job every step of they way. They try and help him and he refuses to listen. I've been with this job also almost 2 years and I have zero issues with it. I've also noticed that he makes no effort with my older kids. No attempt to bond with them at all. He calls one of my kids annoying for being on the phone while playing online games. Any time my youngest makes noise he either scolds him or sends him to his room. My kids deserve better. I have made up my mind to leave.

However the past few weeks my new boyfriend and I have been having issues with communication. Before leaving for Christmas break I had a whole day of Christmas festivities planned. It was the week of my finals but I prioritize holidays even tho he does not. Our thanksgiving was terrbible and he said he was going to be better for Christmas and he just wasn‚Äôt used to it. However he didn‚Äôt come home after work for the Christmas stuff. It got too late and everything had to get cancelled. I was very hurt but when he came home he didn‚Äôt say much. I brought it up and he started yelling at me. He randomly gave a sincere apology after he got done yelling and it was hard to respond. A few minutes past and he got up and left the bedroom to lay out the couch. I begged him not to leave but he said he would come back. He didn‚Äôt and I‚Äôm the morning I went to get him because I needed to be comforted. We started yelling again and my landlord threatened to pull my lease for noise complaints. I spiraled into a panic attack and he helped me despite us arguing. However right when I calmed down he left to help his friend with his car. This isn‚Äôt like him and I begged him to come back soon because I knew I wasn‚Äôt okay. He didn‚Äôt and he came back an hour before we needed to leave for a big even. My eyes were swollen shut from crying but I still got ready because I had been looking forward to the event for months. I was struggling very badly but I wanted to push through. It was for his work and it meant a lot to him as much as it meant to me. However he didn‚Äôt acknowledge anything that had happened between us and I started crying on my way there. He was yelling at me to get better but I couldn‚Äôt drop everything even though I tried. We go through the event and it seemed like he didn‚Äôt want to be around me. He was with his work friends so I went to the bathroom. I‚Äôm narcoleptic and I fell asleep while I‚Äôm there. 30 minutes went by and he was pissed when I came out. I just wanted to relieve him of me being a party pooper but he was pissed I left him. He went on about him saying he did everything for me to feel included and it‚Äôs my fault for not pulling it together. The fight got worse and he started yelling at me in front of everyone outside the venue. I was so embarrassed and I didn‚Äôt raise my voice back. I just took it but he kept on going. I was sobbing in a puddle while he just screamed at me.  I pushed him when he got into my face and I felt terrible. He is a big lan so I in no way could hurt him like this but he freaked out saying I was abusing him. I felt terrible but the yelling wouldn‚Äôt stop. I ran off into the car and the yelling continued and I couldn‚Äôt take it any more. I completely dissociated and was just sitting there sobbing. I told him I never wanted to see him again out of anger and I continued to cry on the floor of the car. W hi we‚Äôre supposed to go to a hotel but we didn‚Äôt and he dropped me off. I told him he didn‚Äôt love me because the way he talked to me and he thought I said I never loved him. I would never say this bc I had this said to me in an argument in my past relationship and it broke me. He drove away and I checked his location and he went to the hotel. Then all of a sudden his location turned off and he sent me this long paragraph that seemed suspicious because he said ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be taken care of when I‚Äôm gone‚Äù. I knew he was talking about life insurance and I freaked out. I sent texts and calls but nothing was going through. He had been suicidal in the past but that was before me. When he finally answered he said he was going to walk into traffic but he‚Äôs going to the hospital to get help.  I messaged his best friend and his friend said he didn‚Äôt say anything about killing himself. I don‚Äôt want to think he used suicide as a form of manipulation but the situation seems so twisted. He never went to the hospital and he just stayed with his friend. I am just thankful he is okay but i mourned him for minutes on the phone and he refuses to acknowledg how this has affected me.  I‚Äôd it wasn‚Äôt for what I said then he would have never done that. But also I don‚Äôt feel like I said that bad of a thing to cause him to kill himself like that after an argument. The next morning he woke up fine but I have been a mess. I thought I lost him and I thought it was all my fault. I haven‚Äôt eaten and I can‚Äôt sleep without the stress. I ended up apologizing for everything and took accountability for causing the fight and instead of him taking accountability of his stuff he just added onto the list of things I needed to better at in the future. When I brought up how he can‚Äôt threaten to kill himself like that then go silent because it was traumatizing all he said was ‚Äúimagine how it was for me if I was about to do it‚Äù. I feel like I don‚Äôt want to be insensitive but i mourned his death just for him to call me and say he didn‚Äôt go to the hospital for help. I want to just move past  because I love him but I don‚Äôt know how to properly. I don‚Äôt want him to do this again‚Ä¶"

We trust each other. He helps me around the house and is truly a partner. We laugh together a lot and truly enjoy each other's company.\n\nThe only problem is in the bedroom. I have a genetic connective tissue disease, combined with terrible endometriosis that has resulted in over 13 abdominal surgeries and even a partial hysterectomy. I often have a lot of pain in that area and intercourse often hurts. When this happens I try to go down on my husband because I still want to pleasure him. I get excited by him getting excited. I don't need intercourse to feel satisfied.\n\nHowever, he doesn't see it this way. He insists that I don't desire him and so he doesn't want me to go down on him because he doesn't want charity. I try to touch him and get him aroused but he can't stay hard.\n\nI can't help but think it might be because I have gained some weight since we met due to surgery and hospitalizations and not being able to exercise regularly. He says he likes my body but in the past he asked me to lose weight. He claims he changed his mind and I don't really need to but I think he is saying that so he doesn't hurt my feelings. I am a dress size 6-8 on average, hourglass shape with some curves. Every woman I see him looking at (on insta or that his friends send, or even his old dating profile matches before we were together) are very skinny women. Not a single one has a body anything like mine.\n\nSo I wonder if I just don't turn him on anymore and he is trying to turn it around on me. I feel so fat now and I am trying hard to lose weight, but until the weight is gone I am very set conscious. I actually want to lose the weight, not just because he wants me to.\n\nSo basically it seems like each of think the other one isn't interested. He rejects me if I'm hurting and doesn't understand that even if I'm in pain or tired, that doesn't mean I don't still desire him. I have explained many times. I have tried talking about it. I don't feel sexy or attractive ever since he asked me to lose weight. I don't know what to do. Any advice?\n\nETA: We aren't having any kind of sex right now. He doesn't ignore my pain or keep going if it hurts. I can tell when it is going to hurt so I just try to do other things for him and he rejects it all."
